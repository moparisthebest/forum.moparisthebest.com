    <title>How to customize your PSP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-customize-your-psp/102632</link>
    <description>So you want your PSP to be unique from your friends then the best way and free way would be to change icons, fonts and the waves. 

What you need:
A PSP with custom firmware (you can read a tutorial on [url=http://psp-hacks.com/forums]These forums[/url] how to install custom firmwares)
[url=http://www.sendspace.com/file/j8cl7u]xmbPackager v0.3[/url] (changing xmb icons)
[url=http://weejewel.net/YAPT/YAPT15.msi]YAPT[/url] (for changing ttf fonts to the fonts that you need on your psp) (this app by S!ms)
[url=http://www.sendspace.com/file/sqgaq1]XMBWave Editor[/url]
[url=http://www.bpsoft.com/downloads/index.html]hexworkshop[/url]
[url=http://dl.qj.net/PSP-Filer-v2.9-PSP-Homebrew-Applications/pg/12/fid/12453/catid/190]PSP Filer[/url] (flashing the font)


Warning this may cause brickage if you do not read the instructions carefully and have the PSP charging!

[b]Xmb Icons - work only on 3.03 OE-A[/b]
Extract the xmbPackager and open the folder.
You should see this: [img]http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/9416/xmbpackfh9.jpg[/img]

Now select &#39;sets&#39; and choose your icons (or get some from the [url=http://psp-hacks.com/forums]PSP Hacks Forums[/url]).
Now copy the icons you want to the folder &#39;icons&#39;, and run &#39;start.cmd&#39;.
Select your firmware (3.02 (Option C) can be used for 3.03 also, but not for 3.10 or up), and press enter.
[img]http://img248.imageshack.us/img248/2246/startcmdtw1.jpg[/img]
Go to recovery menu and go to advanced and toggle flash 0 (you can enter recovery menu by holding down the R button when powering on the psp. 
Go to flash0:\vsh\resource and backup your old topmenu_plugin.rco somewhere and then flash the new one that your .bat created.

Congratz, you now have your custom icons!

[b]XMB Font - works on all custom firmwares[/b]

Install YAPT on to your computer, Put PSP Filer onto your psp like you would put any 1.5 homebrew... ([b]X/PSP/game150[/b] X is the letter of your psp).

After you have done those start YAPT and go to customize xmb.
[url=http://img182.imageshack.us/my.php?image=customizexmbsc5.png][img]http://img182.imageshack.us/img182/7800/customizexmbsc5.th.png[/img][/url]
There push change font and explore to your TTF font.
[url=http://img235.imageshack.us/my.php?image=changefontti6.png][img]http://img235.imageshack.us/img235/6664/changefontti6.th.png[/img][/url]
After that you should be able to see the font on the xmb on screen. 
If it doesnt look nice, look for an other font and change it!
[url=http://img230.imageshack.us/my.php?image=buildfontyz8.png][img]http://img230.imageshack.us/img230/6906/buildfontyz8.th.png[/img][/url]
 Now push build custom font and it will make you an .pgf file. Now go to the place where you installed YAPT and there you should see the ltn0.pgf copy that and paste it straight to X: (X meaning your PSP drive letter!

Now start you PSP Filer on your PSP now go to where you put the ltn0.pgf in Filer (use O to go inside a folder). 
When you have found it push X and then O. 
[url=http://img529.imageshack.us/my.php?image=snap0001zx5.png][img]http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/2913/snap0001zx5.th.png[/img][/url]
After ir has copied the file to RAMDISK push L+&lt;-+R. If you pushed right you should see HACKER MODE in red!
[url=http://img170.imageshack.us/my.php?image=snap0001mg7.png][img]http://img170.imageshack.us/img170/1563/snap0001mg7.th.png[/img][/url]
Then push start until you can see file:[flash0:/].
[url=http://img95.imageshack.us/my.php?image=snap0002bj2.png][img]http://img95.imageshack.us/img95/5708/snap0002bj2.th.png[/img][/url]
When you&#39;re in flash0 got to +font/ and push O then push once down and push X then triangle. There should come a confirmation box.
[url=http://img50.imageshack.us/my.php?image=snap0003en1.png][img]http://img50.imageshack.us/img50/9934/snap0003en1.th.png[/img][/url]
Push O and it should start copying it!
[url=http://img178.imageshack.us/my.php?image=snap0004tq2.png][img]http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/5910/snap0004tq2.th.png[/img][/url]
Now it should have copied it!
Now exit filer by pushing home or start + select!

If everything went right you should now have your custom font!

[b]Custom Waves[/b]

Once you unpacked &#39;XMBWaveEdit.rar&#39;, open system_plugin_bg_deflate.bin in a hex editor.
(I suggest you backup the system_plugin_bg_deflate.bin file, because if you mess it up you need to download it again or extract it again.)Once you opened it, select Edit -&gt; &#39;goto&#39; (Ctrl+G).
[img]http://img118.imageshack.us/img118/9124/hexgotopg1.jpg[/img]
Now choose one of those decimals:
Decimals you can edit for:
Colour: 7767 to 7841
Shape: 528 to 946 (don&#39;t edit too much because if you do, the wave will disappear or become crazy).
Colour and Contrast: 7653 to 7766

[b]Decimals are in pairs of two so, 05, 07, FF.....
Decimals can be changed from 01 through FF!
Make sure you edit the right decimals, you can find these numbers on the left.[/b]
[img]http://img297.imageshack.us/img297/1396/decnumbum3.jpg[/img]
Example for Colour: 7767 to 7841
[img]http://img297.imageshack.us/img297/9602/wavecolourdg6.jpg[/img]
Once you changed everything you want, save the file.
Now run &#39;start.bat&#39; and your new system_plugin_bg.rco will be created.
Now you will want to backup your system_plugin_bg.rco

Flash the file system_plugin_bg.rco to flash0:\vsh\resource.
Get into Recovery mode by pushing R when powering on an then -&gt; Advance -&gt; Toggle USB (Flash0).

I have not written the Icons or the Wave tutorials. I have only written the second one about fonts. So if you see the other ones then you will know it wasnt me who writ them :)</description>

<p>This will not brick. Only if your battery dies when you are flashing. And if it dies it is only a semi-brick that can be easily fixed with custom firmware. If the psp bricks, don’t blame the psp it was you that made a mistake.</p>
