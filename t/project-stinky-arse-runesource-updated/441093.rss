    <description>[size=14pt][font=comic sans ms][b][u]If you comment without reading the whole thing you can suck my dick, as you are obviously a faggot.[/u][/b][/font][/size]

Hehehe, I got a giggle out of the title.

Yo, I thought I would do something totally original and not ripping off Diablo and its various clones at all. I thought, you know what would be cool to make? A real RPG. And since I am not programming superstar and I only know how to do this shit I thought I may as well do it using Runescape.

Anyway, here are my goals:


[ul][li]To make a server that has a main quest and side quests[/li]
[li]To make the main quest actually be a succession of acts (Similar to how Sacred 1 and 2 play really)[/li]
[li]All the skills to actually have a purpose and individual rewards[/li][/ul]


How do you plan to do this, you ask:

Well... So far I have got the introduction complete (and you can watch it in the video) and I have started up the first quest. I have written (on paper) the first quest (Act I) and the first side quest. I don&#39;t want to give too much away here as I want it to still be playable for people reading this but I also want to get people excited (because I want you to play my server when it&#39;s finished)


OHHHHHHHHH, I forgot something. I plan to make it that as you complete the main quest you get &#39;introduced&#39; to the various parts of the world (I am not sure whether players should be stopped from going into places prior to unlocking them or if they just shouldn&#39;t be guided to them until they do the relevant quests.) These areas will also therefore be populated by monsters of relative level and strength (so players who wander in that aren&#39;t strong enough will die anyway)

Also, I think that on death players will just be teleported back to the spawn point (changes depending on progression through main quest) and they wont lose any items (except in PVP of course) as this provides an incentive to keep trying at things which are difficult (and trust me, some of the quest bosses will be difficult).

As for the skills, I intend to have a guild for every single skill which you will encounter during the main quest and will be able to join and work your way up through the ranks of. (Haven&#39;t really developed this too far yet, just want to get the quests under way as of yet)

WHAT ABOUT PVP YOU ASK:

Well, I have thought about this too and what I want to do is make the entire of height level 5 (a carbon copy of the real world) PVP. Just like the original private servers (in those the entire world except for banks and some safe areas was PVP) I also thought it would be cool to fill this version of the world with monsters, I.E. make it dangerous even if you are the only person online.

Back to the quests I think (I have a lot of ideas and I don&#39;t organise them I just splurge them down and then hope I will sort them in my head later):
(Also, this is probably spoilers)
I&#39;m currently thinking that it would be really cool for like the decisions (did I mention that you are going to get to make decisions) that you make to effect the final scene (which I wont reveal(mainly because I haven&#39;t really thought much about it yet)) and also to effect the world around you. I.e. if you piss someone off they wont trade with you but someone else, who you made happy by pissing them off might.

There is a lot of planning left to do, but I find from my observations with previous projects like this that they get caught up in the planning and could bes and never actually finish so I am just doing it as I think of it.

I would love your contributions :) (I really hope that wasn&#39;t too messy, fucked if I am fixing it if it was, you have eyes, use them.)

Oh, here is the video: (I don&#39;t think it&#39;s uploaded completely yet)

UPDATES!!!!!

I tried to rip the Hyperion clipping system but that went all pooey so I gave up. On the other hand, I now have a very cool arena system that supports the easy adding of new arenas (I am hoping to have one for each major city you will travel to and do quests in) and any number of fights (all re playable after you complete all the fights). It also has a best time time system. I have also got the statistics menus, guild menus and arena menus all nicely in the Music tab now (using the 3 buttons at the top) I think it looks quite good. Still working on pictures (I am not on my computer right now) I am still mainly in the stage of writing the quests out. I have got the basic plan for Act II and am still finding the motivation to program the last half of act I.</description>
