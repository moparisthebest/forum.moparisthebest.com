ADMINS

Co -owner -
Content Developer(s) -
Web Executive -
Senior Promotion Manager -
Hoster - Me Or Somelse

Moderators
GFX Executive -
Junior Promotion Manager -
Community Manager -
Player Representative - Will be decided ingame


Information on Hoster
I may need a hoster depending how good my connection is. The Hoster will need some type of good Core Processor with 8gb RAM. His

internet downloads at 2-3mb/s. He is very reliable and after 3-4 weeks into the

release of the server, and will invest in getting a Dedicated Server.



Information on Promotion

It would be nice if you had Runescape related Subscribers in which you will upload a video

about the server etc.
Information on Owner/President

My names Tyler . I am 16, I come from Washington . I have coded RSPS&#39;s for

18-2 4months. I have run 1 pretty succesful servers over the time which has made me some profit

, but the thing that stops me from keep on going is that I had too much

work to do and had little help. I feel that this plan of mine has a great deal of

potential and within a few weeks we will have a massively succesful server.


Rewards

Once accepting your position, I will not lie, it will be hard work and tiresome.

But if you are mature and responsible and work hard, you will be given a bigger

percentage of profits. Not only will you recieve IRL money, you will be an

official in a most likely huge community.
