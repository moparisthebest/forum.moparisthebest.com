<p>…I felt like I wanted to make the server more kind of object oriented instead of having few classes stuffed with codeblocks screaming to be organized.<br>
I have tried this a few times, but due to lack of Java-knowledge, many of my Fail.java-files have been moved to the recycle bin. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
Today/this evening/this night I finally ended up with an attempt where I feel I can briefly see a light from the other side of the tunnel.</p>
<p>What I have done is to make a Server-class where I intend to store server related methods made more smooth than in a standard winterLove base<br>
and leting another class manage it so I can create any class, create an object (preferably a singleton) and use quick calls to start the server,<br>
open it for network connections, start it’s cycle updating, stop the server, etc…</p>

<p>Now, please tell me what you think of my work, wether it’s good, wether it’s bad, if it contain’s fatal errors or if some of the comments are simply giving straight out missleading information.<br>
I am aware that it’s method for cycle updating is empty and that it’s not doing anything with the connection like passing it to a <span class="bbcode-b">PlayerHandler.class</span> to give it a player ID and so,<br>
but that will be done trough the class with the main-method.</p>
<p>Thanks for you’r time! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

[li]Also try to not comment every single thing (I over-comment sometimes too).[/li]<br>
[li]I would abstractize your server class and put your connection acceptor into another class.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>A basic model (some of it may be messy, made up on the spot at 3AM).</p>
<p>[code=java]abstract class AbstractEngine {</p>
<p>protected String name;<br>
protected int port;<br>
protected boolean running;<br>
private ConnectionAcceptor acceptor;</p>

<p>public void Sleep() {<br>

<p>My own preferred model varies a little from this though, ie I use a ServerProperties structure to load and store server info in (name, port, node-id, pass-salt [probably a bad idea] etc. etc.).</p>

<p>I thought I had to implement the Runnable interface to create the Thread-objects and the abstract run-methods. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/confusedae52.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"><br>
(Would I in this case, be better of to NOT implement Runnable, but instead extend Thread.class)?<br>
I am a perfectionist, therefor I try to add comments to every variable/method in a class to ensure that everything is clear.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/expressionlessae52.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

Good to know. I first tried to compile the class, but it would not let me untill I wrote the run-method.
<blockquote>Good luck with your next project and try to move to better sources once you understand the basics to learn good habits.</blockquote>
Thank you very much. I understand that the server is simply communicating with the clients, but I need a clear overview to get the "AHA!",
and to get that view, I find it helpfull to write parts of the code myself to get some knowledge on other ways it could have been done instead
of just reading tons of tutorials. I am a slow learner. But I AM moving forward.
<p>I got the base <span class="bbcode-b">RuneSource</span> recommended. I think I will be moving to that next.</p>
