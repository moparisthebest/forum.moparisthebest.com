        <p>In my mind and the mind of many cheaters, I am the furthest along in cheating for Runescape 2. My knowledge is the most vast there is for now. I'm your most valuable resource as a community. I'd use my knowledge to your benefit... If I say something other than flamage, you should probably listen. (yeah I can be a dick at times, can't we all? lol) Semaphore was making option-pushing bots when I found him. I told him my concept of a bot, gave him my basic framework and he ran with it. Excelled, he even listened when I told everyone that they log mouse and focus actions, yet no one else listened until he posted more in depth information about it. (Oh yeah, you can ignore my flamage. I suggest you do that, as an "emo" I tend to have a bit of a vendetta against lives...)</p>

<p>Semaphore is gone, I can contact him because I have a real-life-relationship with him. But I'm not going to contact him to badger him when I can answer you myself...  Which makes sense when you put into perspective that we were partners and shared source codes of practicly everything. </p>

<p>Anyways, to answer some inevetable questions, YES. I have xscar's sources well sources from early on in the project. Anyways, if any of you <br>remember, xscar is just the third generation of the thing I started (Scar-J [the java to scar communicating client]), which I abandoned due to lack of interest. If your memory is SUPERB you'll remember that before aryan, regex also worked on a project like this :-p. He too abandoned it. Just know xScar wasnt as good as it seemed... kkay?</p>

<p>BACK ON SUBJECT NOW.</p>

<p>I'm bored out of my mind. I've found more detection routines than anyone to date. I've shared most of them, not directly: I shared with semaphore, and he shared with public. (He figured you guys would listen, I figured you wouldnt so I never shared... He has more faith in people than myself though sooooo yeah.) Anyways, we should learn basics of things... There's an architecture that's been used for automated self-maintenance in server infrastructures for years, I forget the details but it applies very much so to bots nowadays.. Here I'll uml it.</p>

<pre><code>   bot -------------&gt; updater
       \                           |
        \--------------- bytecode
         \                         |
          \--------------- regex
           \                       |
            \------ dynamic memory
             \                     |
              \_____ assumptions</code></pre>

<p>Not too hard to understand in my mind, simply you have the Bot, it decides it's broken, it calls the updater, and the updater decides how it is broken, and applies one or all of the (4) methods of updating. They update accordingly and return the bot. Bytecode is of course bytecode, regex is of course regexing the source... Dynamic memory is what I outlined on how to do and then deleted half the article. Assumptions is my fiddle-stick "artificial intelligent" (as krichkovskoy says... lol) updater. Assumptions is the fastest updater, dynamic memory is the second fastest, regex the fourth, and bytecode the third. </p>

<p>We all know the first 3, the fourth one is too complex unless you're majoring in the field of mathematics or quantem mathematics... Because it's the use of datamining and complex algorithms to find patterns fast as shit.</p>

<p>Anyways, peace.</p>

        <p>I'm back (been in NYC), and I've realized that a BlackBerry just doesn't cut it for more than, eh, maybe checking the news. So I'm still where I was about a week ago with the DM updater stage, that being a bit lost. I've obviously missed the point somewhere along the line. Care to elaborate a little bit on that, or perhaps tell us a little bit of applying "quantem [sic] mathematics" to RuneScape <img src="http://forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>PS - My memory is SUPERB++, because I've got RegeX's source from that project <img src="http://forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>Most of the memory-mapping stuff was lifted from some SF project I think. It's still a cool idea even if no one with the skill to pull it off has ever cared enough to do so.</p>

<p>The <span class="bbcode-i">plebs pleraque</span>, to correct a phrase of the originial developer's, love xSCAR because it is both unattainable by them (therefore presumably good) and attached to a person that "leet" people were impressed with. Plus, there's the occasional glimmer of thought that he might have been a mole (:D) and of course a Jagex dev would be really good at hacking his own game. So it's like AutoRune now, a program that must be good just because of its name. In fact, if some random noob came out with something and called it <span class="bbcode-i">xSCAR 2</span> I bet it would be very successful.</p>

<p>Don't give them ideas man, please. </p>

<p>Seriously, RaW must have made hundreds of dollars, Autorune 2 is vaporeware...and he's still blowing smoke out of his ass</p>

<blockquote>AutoRune 2 is now a few days overdue, therefore it could be released any day now. Keep your eyes open, and chill.</blockquote><blockquote>I bet you all wonder WTF has happened? No Accounts? No Threads, No Posts, NO AR2 PM!!!,

<p>Well, I've now fixed the forum, and after tonight no script kiddies will be able to attack it again, I put money on it.</p>

<p>You are going to receive your AR2 authorisation quite soon, before AR2 is actually released; which will be on Friday/Saturday/Sunday, one of those three days.</p>

<p>You are still able to buy Authorisation Accounts with RuneScape 2 GP, which goes as follows:</p>

<ul><li>4mill RS2 Each</li></ul>

<p>In order to buy an authorisation, please U2U [message] me on these forums with the subject: 'Buying authorisation', I will then PM you a place we can trade, and as soon as you are online and ready let me know and I'll come and collect the gold.</p>

<p>By the way, if you have REVERESED your PayPal money, I'd kindly ask you not to do that as I'm working very hard on fixing everything else for you? Why give me PayPal as a problem?</p>

<p>I'll post more for you tonight,</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Josh</p>
