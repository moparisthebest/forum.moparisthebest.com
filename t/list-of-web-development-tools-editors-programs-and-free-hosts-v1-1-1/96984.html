<span class="bbcode-b">TopStyle Lite</span></span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">This is a well-known Windows CSS editor that can also edit HTML code. The editor's speciality is that it allows you to create Cascading Style Sheets in a fairly simple manner - you can select the features you want from a side panel of the editor and it will generate the corresponding style sheet (you still need some CSS knowledge though - this is not a WYSIWYG editor). You can also edit HTML code with the editor. The Lite version, which is free, only allows you to create inline Cascading Style Sheets. The Pro version (not free) allows you to create external style sheets and includes built-in validators that checks your style sheets and HTML documents for correctness (among other features).</code></pre>

<pre><code class="lang-auto"> Syntax Highlighting and Syntax Folding  
 
 
 Supported languages : 
C C++ Java C# XML HTML 
PHP CSS makefile ASCII art (.nfo) doxygen ini file 
batch file Javascript ASP VB/VBS SQL Objective-C 
RC resource file Pascal Perl Python Lua TeX 
TCL Assembler Ruby Lisp Scheme Properties 
Diff Smalltalk Postscript VHDL Ada Caml 
AutoIt KiXtart Matlab Verilog Haskell InnoSetup 
CMake 
 
 WYSIWYG  
 
 
 If you have a colour printer, print your source code (or whatever you want) in colour.  
 User Defined Syntax Highlighting  
 
 
 It allows user to define his own language : not only the syntax highlighting keywords, but also the syntax folding keywords, comment keywords and the operators. ( screenshot1, screenshot2, screenshot3, screenshot4 ).  
 Auto-completion  
 
 
 For most supported languages, user can make his/her own API list (or download the api files from dowload section). Once the api file is ready, type Ctrl+Space to launch this action (see screenshot). For more information about Auto-completion, please see Auto-completion HOWTO.  
 Multi-Document  
 
 
 You can edit several documents at the same time.  
 Multi-View  
 
 
 You have two views at same time. That means you can visualize (edit) 2 different documents at the same time (screenshot). You can visualize (edit) in the 2 views one document at 2 different positions as well. The modification of document in one view will carry out in another view (i.e. you modify the SAME document when you are in clone mode, see screenshot).  
 Regular Expression Search/Replace supported  
 
 
 You can search and replace one string in the document by using the regular expression.  
 Full Drag ‘N' Drop supported  
 
 
 You can open a document by drag &amp; drop. You can also move your document from a position (or even a view) to another by drag &amp; drop.  
 Dynamic position of Views  
 
 
 The user can set the position of the views dynamically (only in 2 views mode : the splitter can be set in horizontal or in vertical), see screenshot.  
 File Status Auto-detection  
 
 
 If you modify or delete a file which opened in Notepad++, you will be notified to update your document (reload the file or remove the file).  
 Zoom in and zoom out  
 
 
 That's another fantastic function of Scintilla component. Just see screenshot.  
 Multi-Language environment supported  
 
 
 The Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Hebrew Windows environments are supported. See Notepad++ under the Chinese Windows , under the Arabic Windows and under the Hebrew Windows in action screenshot.  
 Bookmark  
 
 
 User can just click on the bookmark margin (located right side of line number margin) or type Ctrl+F2 to toggle a book mark. To reach the bookmark, type just F2 (Next bookmark) or Shift+F2 (Previous bookmark). To clear all bookmarks, click the Menu Search-&gt;Clear All bookmarks. See screenshot.  
 Brace and Indent guideline Highlighting  
 
 
 When the caret stay beside of one of those symbol { } [ ] ( ) , the symbol beside of caret and its symmetric opposite symbol will be highlighted, as well as the indent guideline (if any) in order to locate the block more easily. See screenshot1, screenshot2 .  
 Macro recording and playback  </code></pre>

Taking Joomla! to the Next Level

Out of the box, Joomla! does a great job of managing the content needed to make your website sing. But for many people, the true power of Joomla! lies in the application framework that makes it possible for thousands of developers around the world to create powerful add-ons and extensions. Here are just some examples of the hundreds of available extensions:

    * Dynamic form builders
    * Business or organizational directories
    * Document management
    * image and multimedia galleries
    * E-commerce and shopping cart engines
    * Forums and chat software
    * Calendars
    * Blogging software
    * Directory services
    * Email newsletters
    * Data collection and reporting tools
    * Banner advertising systems
    * Subscription services
    * and many, many more…

You can find more examples over at our growing Joomla! Extensions Directory. Prepare to be amazed at the amount of exciting work produced by our active developer community!
Joomla! for Developers

Many companies or organizations have requirements that go beyond what is available in the basic Joomla! package or in a freely available extension.

Thankfully, Joomla! offers a powerful application framework that makes it easy for developers to create sophisticated add-ons that extend the power of Joomla! into virtually unlimited directions.

Using the core framework, developers can easily build:

    * Integrated e-commerce systems
    * Inventory control systems
    * Data reporting tools
    * Custom product catalogs
    * Complex business directories
    * Reservation systems
    * Communication tools
    * Application bridges
    * or any kind of application to suit a unique need…

If your company or organization hires a third party Joomla! developer or builds in-house software using the Joomla! framework, you are building on an open platform that does not tie you to any one developer or to a proprietary, closed application.

You can learn more about developing on the Joomla! framework over at our developer’s network. The beauty of Joomla! is that you can leverage our framework and user interface to deliver applications to your end users in a familiar, powerful environment.
So what’s the catch?

There is no catch. Joomla! is free, open, and available to all under the GPL license. We don’t claim to be perfect, and can’t promise to meet every requirement in the world. But for many web applications, our software is perfectly suited for the job. We are adding great new features with each release, and with the help and advice of our incredible user community we plan on delivering award-winning software for years to come.</code></pre>

<p>i actually meant editors but your topic title was confusing</p>
<p>edit: i have to add that zend studio is really fucking sexy, it supports ALL code completion, and if you have written your own classes, you can have it auto complete by doing something like this(simplexml in this example)</p>
<p>[php]$conf = simplexml_load_file(“xml/conf.xml”);<br>
/* <span class="mention">@var</span> $conf SimpleXMLElement */[/php]</p>
<p>and from there on, $conf can be auto-completed with EVERYTHING in the class SimpleXMLElement <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink1bce.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>edit of the edit: yes, dreamweaver can go ***** off <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink1bce.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
