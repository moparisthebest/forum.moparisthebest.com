<p>Note a lot of the time we WERE talking about different things, I was talking about once you’ve written to the stream, the things are sent to the client in the exact same order as you wrote them, which is why I said it guarantees order <span class="bbcode-i">just like normal IO</span> (hence why I even mentioned the flip method). I assumed you were saying that things are sometimes sent to the client in a different order than they were in the buffer when the send method was called (to be honest I still don’t know what you were/are talking about, because you change the discussion so much…) because yes, that is <span class="bbcode-b">completely</span> wrong unless you are sending datagram packets. If you care to explain what you WERE talking about, perhaps we can have a civilized discussion. I don’t know why you insist on calling me a moron or idiot because we obviously have a failure of communication and interpretation, but I’ll try not to do the same.</p>
<p>As for the contradictory statements, they all say the same thing except the middle one, which I explained in the paragraph above.</p>
<p>Enjoy.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’ve been the one attempting to change the discussion completely, because you’re talking out of your ass, and pretending I’m saying things I’m clearly not.</p>
<p>No, a lot of the time <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> were talking about different things, I continually corralled to back to the actual point.</p>
<p>Okay, let’ pretend you were talking about once you’ve written to the stream.  You’ve no moved away from what asynchronous IO is, and to the protocol being used.  And in that case you’re still wrong, because not every protocol guarantees order.  Also, blocking IO makes no guarantees as to the ordering…</p>
<p>I’ve never said that, except when talking about protocols that don’t guarantee ordering…  I’ve already explain what I originally said, go back and read.  Now, even <span class="bbcode-b">if</span> I did say that sending things asynchronously doesn’t guarantee ordering I would be correct; thus your initial theory that I didn’t know what asynchronous meant would still have no basis.</p>
<p>You’re assuming that the transport-layer protocol guarantees delivery order, asynchonous IO says absolutely nothing about the protocol that needs to be used…  You’re just make irrelevant, and retarded assumptions to make it seem like you’re correct, when you’re fundamentally wrong.  Also, there are more transport-layer protocols that don’t have guaranteed delivery order than ones that do.</p>
<p>If you care to actually read what I’ve said you’d notice I’ve already explained it.</p>
<p>You’re the idiot because you’re consistently changing your position, and failing to understand what is being said.</p>
<p>No, they switch pretty much every time…</p>
<p>This one is implying that it guarantees ordering.</p>

<p>As you can see when I explicitly point it out, you’ve said it guarantees ordering twice, and has nothing to do with ordering three times.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I’ve said in all seven posts (regarding this specifically) that it has nothing to do with order.  Not once did I contradict myself; though I’ll admit the first post wasn’t very clear, but I made it abundantly clear after that.</p>

        <p>Again, I was referring to the stream sending to the client (<span class="bbcode-b">not</span> writing data into the buffer), and that’s what I was talking about the entire time. Also I’d like to point out you saying: [quote=“CodeForFame, post:31, topic:362546”]You’re now talking about writing to a stream that is using a protocol that guarantees delivery order…  The underlying protocol has absolutely nothing to do with if it is asynchronous or synchronous, and that is what ultimately guarantees delivery order.[/quote]Here you recognize what I am talking about, but you change the subject <span class="bbcode-i">back</span> to asycn vs synch IO, which I think we both agree does not determine order (as we’ve both said it multiple times)…</p>
<p>I still stand by what I said in regards to <span class="bbcode-b">sending</span> data, which is what you keep quoting.<br>
I also don’t understand why you keep only giving parts of my quotes, for example that first quote you say supports ordering is clearly saying that asynchronous IO does not modify the information at all, which means that while it doesn’t ‘disorder’ the data on purpose, it also doesn’t order it or do anything else.</p>
<p>At the third quote, I did not say “Sending something asynchronously doesn’t guarantee ordering…”, and you’re being a hypocrite by putting words into my mouth as well. If you read on (again you only included part of the quote), I continue to talk about the stream itself, which supports my point that I’m talking about after the data is written into stream, and is being sent to the client. You even recognize this (view the quote at the top of this post) but now you change your mind and say it has to do with asynch IO…?</p>
<p>When are you going to get over yourself and realize we are both right about the ordering of the data when talking about asynch vs synch, but I was just talking about something else when talking about writing to a stream (because again that’s what I interpreted your first post to be about)? This entire thing has been blown way out of proportion :rolleyes:</p>
<p>EDIT - I’m done here, you obviously can’t handle anyone else possibly being right about anything (even if they admit you are right too…) so I’ll step down before this goes on for eternity.</p>

        <p>There is no reason. Maybe the original programmers thought sending them in “one go” would make a difference, but it doesn’t, other than the possibility that the client would receive the packets at a later time. Yes, you have the ability to remove packets, but I can’t think of a reason why this would be useful.</p>
<p>CodeForFame, your argument with Davidi2 was because of a misunderstanding on his behalf, and you didn’t help matters either by assuming MINA didn’t queue the packets internally. Why would you want to continue your pointless argument?</p>

        <p>[quote=“iKilem, post:46, topic:362546”]There is no reason. Maybe the original programmers thought sending them in “one go” would make a difference, but it doesn’t, other than the possibility that the client would receive the packets at a later time. Yes, you have the ability to remove packets, but I can’t think of a reason why this would be useful.</p>
<p>CodeForFame, your argument with Davidi2 was because of a misunderstanding on his behalf, and you didn’t help matters either by assuming MINA didn’t queue the packets internally. Why would you want to continue your pointless argument?[/quote]</p>
<p>Classic was always about being available, especially to people with terrible connections, and computers; I originally played on a PII with 256MB or 512MB of RAM (I upgraded around the time that I started playing, I don’t remember if it was before or after), and had a dial-up connection.  I know for sure other people had worse computers…</p>
<p>Anyway, removing outdated packets would help both of those, and I don’t see why you would want to make the game unavailable to some people…</p>
<p>As for continuing with Davidi2, it’s purely because he refuses to admit he made a mistake, and thinks he’s right in every sense.  Also, I clarified and admitted to not knowing that MINA guaranteed ordering, but that still doesn’t make my initial statement wrong, like he’s trying to make it out to be.</p>
<p>BTW congrats on mod Davidi2, don’t go abusing it now…</p>
