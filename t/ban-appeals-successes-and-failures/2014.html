<p>FAILED: "I was banned for macroing, i dont even know what macroing is. I've read the rules, i think cheating is a terrible thing and should never be done ever, I HATE people who try to cheat. I dont know how i was marked as cheating, but i never have and never will. I hope you will see this error, I Love my runescape account..." </p>

<p>-their response- We are 100% confident in our macro detection systems, and in the highly trained staff who monitor and take action based on the results presented by these systems, and as such are 100% confident that you have been using such a program. This is a clear violation of the Rules of Conduct and as such your account has been placed on a permanent ban.</p>

<p>I'm hoping you guys will add to this, failed or accepted. If you used the same general idea and failed/passed please post also, seeing if one works 50% or 75% or something would be handy also</p>

        <p>Failed:<br>Hello Jagex,<br>I would like you to specify what I was "macroing". You may think that I was because I was buying a ton of death runes, or smelting with superheat item for about 3 hours at a time? I am not sure but I believe that you have made a mistake. I have NEVER "macroed" on this account and I believe that it should be unbanned because it has been banned in error.</p>

<p>I recently broke up with my girlfriend and she got really pissed. I don't blame her. She caught me sleeping with another girl.She wanted revenge so she broke into my house and autoed on my account to get me banned. I know I shouldn't have told her my password, but it was a deep relationship and we shared everything with eachother. If you could kindly unban my account so I could have another chance.<br>[With this one, I got: We have reviewed our detailed IP logs and have and have no reason to believe that anyone else accessed this account at the time of the offence.</p>

<p>I have investigated this matter fully and so no further ban appeals for this permanent ban will be considered.]</p>

<p>I've never had one work <img src="http://forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=3" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

        <p>"Dear *******,</p>

<p>Thank you for your appeal,</p>

<p>You have been caught breaking one of our Rules of RuneScape and as a result you have received a Permanent Ban.<br>The Rule you were caught breaking was:</p>

<p>Rule 7: You must not attempt to use other programs (e.g. bots, macros or autominers) in conjunction with our games<br>to give yourself an unfair advantage at the game. You also may not circumvent any of our mechanisms designed to log out inactive users automatically</p>

<p>For more information please see the Macro FAQ in the FAQ section of the RuneScape website.</p>

<p>However as this appears to be your first offence we will lift this permanent ban but your account will still have black marks placed on it and you will still receive a 3 day ban. Further to this we will be monitoring your account very closely and if we receive any further Abuse Reports against you, your account will be banned permanently with no further chances given.</p>

<p>I suggest you take this time to make yourself familiar with our Rules of Conduct which can be found in the 'Information and Advice' section (left) on the main page of our website (www.RuneScape.com) by selecting the link named 'Read our rules'. This will make you more aware and help you avoid being banned from the game in future.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>RuneScape Customer Support"</p>

<p>I had autoed on my main to autofight it was lvl 89 so i told them that i deeply regretted it, one of my friends had been doing it and i was just curious and i was unbanned <img src="http://forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>I got one autoed account back wich is my <em>skilled</em> main now but that was a long time ago</p>

1) Always stay nice, Sincirely ( Or how you spell it anyways ) at the end of the letter

<br>

2) Try as much adding info, or what they NEED to know ( What people said around you, got any events ? Simple cuz you can look at the log for this stuff )

<br>

3) Try not to overdo it like:

<br>

<blockquote>I think cheating is a terrible thing and should never be done ever, I HATE people who try to cheat</blockquote><blockquote>She wanted revenge so she broke into my house and autoed on my account to get me banned</blockquote>

<p>Really guys, do you believe it yourself?<br>Sorry to say but cmon, you can think of something better then that, aslong as its believable</p>
