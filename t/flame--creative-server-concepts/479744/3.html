<p>I will continue to update this thread with ideas sent to me and ideas that I happen to just think up of.</p>
<p>[center]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/center]<br>
[center]<span class="bbcode-u">Minigames</span>[/center]</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="bbcode-u">Backyard Frenzy</span></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>[u][b]Location: Castle Wars[/b][/u]
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">The Objective:</span></span><br>
[ul][li]The zombies have invaded your neighboring armory! You have to stop them before they take over your last resource stop, and time is running out! You have 10 minutes to kill as many zombies as you can.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">The Resources:</span></span><br>
[ul]You are provided with resources to help you overcome the zombie invasion. You must use these to your advantage, and only time will tell who will prevail.<br>
[list][li]<span class="bbcode-u">Healing Kits</span> - These kits will heal just about any illness and injury you can imagine. Things such as poison, cuts, scratches, and even broken limbs are no match against the abilities of these. Using the castle wars bandages as the model, these kits heal poison, give a 5% hunger boost, and heal 10/99 hp.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u">Explosive Potions</span> - These remarkable weapons blow up just about anything that manages to put foot on them. When dropped, you have 5 seconds to <em><span class="bbcode-i">run</span></em> before these self-destruct, inflicting 20/99 damage on anything within a 7x7 range. These use the castle wars explosive potion as the model.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u">Pickaxes</span> - These are useful when trying to dig through the underground tunnels. Because of the reckless nature of zombies, there have been many collapsed passageways under your armories and supply castle. These miraculous items have a 75% chance of breaking through each individual collapsed passage, and a 25% of breaking due to not digging through. One can only hold 3 pickaxes at one time.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u"> Barricades</span> - Zombies are stupid. So stupid, in fact, that a simple wooden barricade is enough to temporarily stand in their way of getting any further. When placed, zombies are able to attack them, and set them on fire. Only 10 barricades can be placed at one time.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u"> Rocks/Catapult</span> - Ever wondered what it would be like to crush a zombie with some 50 pound rocks? Well, now you can! The catapult can be upgraded to three different tiers, with each tier being able to hold heavier rocks with a wider range of damage.<br>
[list][li]Tier 1:[/li][/list] - The first catapult tier can hold 25-pound stones. These stones inflict 10 damage to all enemies within a 5x5 range. <span class="bbcode-b">COST = 5 ZOMBIE KILLS</span><br>
[list][li]Tier 2:[/li][/list] - The second catapult tier can hold 50-pound stones. These stones inflict 25 damage to all enemies within a 8x8 range. <span class="bbcode-b">COST = 10 ZOMBIE KILLS</span><br>
[list][li]Tier 3:[/li][/list] - The third, and strongest, catapult tier, can hold 100-pound boulders. These boulders inflict 50-75 damage to all enemies within a 10x10 range. <span class="bbcode-b">COST = 25 ZOMBIE KILLS</span><br>
[/list]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">The Rewards:</span></span><br>
Should you manage to prevail over most, if not all, of the invading zombies, there are spoils to be rewarded.<br>
[list]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u">Prize One:</span> - <span class="bbcode-b">PRICE = 20 INDIVIDUAL ZOMBIE KILLS</span> [list type=decimal]<br>
[li]10,000 gold coins to be spent however the victorious pleases[/li]<br>
[li]The <span class="bbcode-i">Amateur Zombie Slaughterer</span> cloak. This cloak provides the wearer a 5% slower hunger rate.[/li]<br>
[/list][/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u">Price Two:</span> - <span class="bbcode-b">PRICE = 50 INDIVIDUAL ZOMBIE KILLS</span> [list type=decimal]<br>
[li]50,000 gold coins to be spent however the victorious pleases[/li]<br>
[li]The <span class="bbcode-i">Boots of the Apocalypse</span>, which provide the wearer with a 10% slower hunger rate, and gives a 7% defense boost to the wearer.[/li]<br>
[/list][/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-u">Price Three:</span> - <span class="bbcode-b">PRICE = 100 INDIVIDUAL ZOMBIE KILLS</span><br>
This tier can only be given to the greatest of the apocalypse adventurers. To achieve this is to achieve true mastery in the art of zombie hunting.[list type=decimal]<br>
[li]100,000 gold coins to be spent however the victorious pleases[/li]<br>
[li]The <span class="bbcode-i">Amateur Zombie Slaughterer cloak, Boots of the Apocalypse, &amp; The Zombie Skin Outfit.</span> The zombie skin outfit can be put to great use, as it gives the wearer the ability to overcome the aggressiveness of all zombies, and seem to fit in amongst them.[/li]<br>
[/list][/list]</p>

<blockquote>[u]Storyline:[/u]
The dragons are invading the wilderness, and are quickly making their way into edgeville! It is now up to you, adventurer, to stop them from wrecking havoc all across Geilinor. Should you choose to embark on this quest, there are great rewards if you complete it.
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Difficulty: </span>Epic</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Requirements:</span><br>
[list]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-i">Recommended:</span> [list]<br>
[li]50+ defense[/li]<br>
[li]30+ strength[/li]<br>
[li]Good armour (preferably rune+)[/li]<br>
[li]Anti-fire shield/Dragonfire shield[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>

[li]Skills[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]50+ Summoning[/li]<br>
[li]75+ Thieving[/li]<br>
[li]A combat level of at least 80[/li]<br>
[/list][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The Walkthrough:</span></p>
<p>[ol][li]To start the quest, talk to the warrior that is guarding the wilderness ditch. He will ask if you would like to assist him in fending off the recent invasion of dragons. Say yes, and he will tell you to report deeper into the wilderness to get your task.[/li]<br>
[li]Near level 20 wilderness, you will see a cutscene in which a warrior defeats a dragon. When the cutscene ends, walk up to him, and say that the warrior guard sent you to him. He will tell you that your next task is to attempt to make negotiations with the King Black Dragon, who is the one responsible for the recent invasions.[/li]<br>
[li]You must dwell even deeper into the wilderness now, where you will find the King Black Dragon’s lair, which is being heavily guarded by the King Dragon’s minions. You must be able to slay all three guards, who are level 60+. Upon killing the final dragon, a key will be dropped that will allow you to gain entrance to the King Black Dragon’s lair.[/li]<br>
[li]You will now enter the King Black Dragon’s lair. Another cutscene occurs where you are spotted walking into the lair, and the King Black Dragon will ask in a very rude manner what you are doing infiltrating his lair. You will say that you have been sent by the Warriors of Edgeville to demand an answer as to why the dragons have been attacking the humans.[/li]<br>
[li]The King Black Dragon will say that it is because the humans have stolen the egg of the King Black Dragon. You now ask that if you bring back the egg, will the King Black Dragon stop the attacks upon the humans? He will say yes.[/li]<br>
[li]The King Black Dragon will send you back to the humans to retrieve his egg. Upon talking to the guard, you will discover that the egg was stolen by the humans, and was being hidden in the Varrock castle. The only way to get the egg is to talk the Varrock King into giving you the egg.[/li]<br>
[li]You now must go to the King of Varrock and talk him into giving you the egg. He will not agree to give you the egg, as he sees it as a trophy to his royalty. He will, though, tell you that the egg in on the top floor of the castle, hidden in a chest.[/li]<br>
[li]Venture to the top of the castle, and use your thieving skill to unlock the chest. When you open the chest, 2 guards will see you, and you must kill them in order to get the egg. The guards are both level 20.[/li]<br>
[li]After killing the guards, take the egg and go back to edgeville.[/li]<br>
[li]Now, travel back to the warrior guards and tell them you have the egg. Upon hearing this, the warrior will give you a quick teleport to the King Black Dragon’s lair.[/li]<br>
[li]When you give the King Black Dragon his egg, he will now say that he will kill you as vengeance for causing him so much trouble. Prepare for a boss fight![/li]<br>
[li]Slay the King Black Dragon, and a cutscene will now occur in which the egg hatches, and a baby black dragon appears. Having seen you first, it will consider you its parent, and now be your familiar.[/li][/ol]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The Rewards:</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]The black dragon familiar[/li]<br>
[li]The <span class="bbcode-i">Dragon Kinship</span> ring, which makes all dragons no longer aggressive to you[/li]<br>
[li]100,000 gold coins[/li]<br>
[li]An experience lamp granting 5,000 thieving experience[/li][/ul]</p>
