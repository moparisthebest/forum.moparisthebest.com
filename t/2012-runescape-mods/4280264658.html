<p>If they weren’t ment to help a player ingame then why have the crown showing ingame?

It was an expression, of course they don’t get paid becasue anyone can become an ingame mod. I just think they were made a Mod for a reason and that was because they helped people so jagex made them a game mod.</p>

        <p>[quote=“zerak93, post:20, topic:428026”]Lmfao… Why are you saying that they have alot of people after them ???</p>
<p>Only 1-3 was following them… And they had private offline.</p>
<p>And also, why are they walking around? That’s what I am saying.<br>
Is it because it was a free world?<br>
Is it because they want some fun?<br>
Well, how can you have fun with some emotes that your company has build for some ages ago? -.-[/quote]<br>
You fucking kidding me?  Maybe he likes the emote?  Maybe he enjoys the newer animations on it?  You question why the mod walks around when you’re the dick that’s GE standing.</p>
