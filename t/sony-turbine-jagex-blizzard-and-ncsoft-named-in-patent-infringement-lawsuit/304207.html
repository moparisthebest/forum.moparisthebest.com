<blockquote>It seems to be a World of Lawsuits (TM) recently in our industry. Bloggers are being sued for libel, NCsoft is being sued for patent infringement, Linden Labs is being sued for trademark violations, Turbine is suing Atari, and now five companies are all being sued over a patent dispute.
<p>The Boston Globe has reported that Paltalk Holdings Inc. has filed a complaint in Texas against Sony Corp., Activision Blizzard Inc., Turbine Inc., NCsoft Corp., and Jagex Ltd. all for games that violate their patent on computers sharing data so that all users can see the same virtual environment. The games in question are EverQuest, World of Warcraft, Lord of the Rings Online, Guild Wars, and RuneScape (in order of the companies as named above.)</p>
<p>What makes this lawsuit different from the standard patent shakedowns that we’ve been reporting on is that the patent has already been successfully used in court. Paltalk has already sued, and won against, Microsoft.</p>
<p>In 2006, the company sued Microsoft over the multiplayer features included in Halo series. Microsoft took the suit to court, but ended up settling with Paltalk in mid-trial by paying an undisclosed sum of money. This win gives the lawsuit more legs to stand on, hence why Paltalk is now going after all of the industry bigwigs, including Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p>If you’re confused as to how Microsoft settling to Paltalk gives them more credibility in court, it’s because Microsoft’s bow lends credit to the validity of the patents. This prior case can be used in court, making the suit hard to defend against. Turbine and NCsoft, as stated before, are also already involved in suits of their own, making legal defense trickier for these two companies.</p>

<p>I think it’s ridiculous, yet amusing at the same time. Microsoft settled to them, so I’d imagine the other companies will, too. I’d like to see what comes of this in the upcoming months. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

        <p>It’s about time Andrew Gower and Jagex drank some of their own medicine after issuing god only knows how many frivolous emails to people running websites like this one.</p>
<p>It’s too bad that nobody gives a shit what Jagex lawyers say and that we keep undermining the integrity of their product. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> It’s much harder for a company to get away with something like this, because they’re actually worth suing.</p>
<p>Suck it up Jagex, enjoy being on the receiving end of those bullshit DMCA notices you send out.</p>
<p>Oh, and in keeping with the nature of Runescape:<br>
Support, kthxbai.</p>
<p>EDIT: This post was made by Mark Gerhard on the Runescape forums regarding the lawsuit:</p>
<p>[quote="“Mark Gerhard”"]Hi Guys,<br>
Just to bring you up to speed, whilst Paltalk is making as much PR capital as they can on this matter, Jagex have yet to be served with any court papers and I expect being a British company it will probably take a few months before that happens.</p>
<p>Jagex respect all 3rd party IP rights and prides itself on developing all of our own technology which has not only made us a leader in this space but also means we are confident having assessed their patents, that there is no merit to their claims and this is all simply the work of ambulance chasers trying to extort money from a successful games studio.</p>
<p>Naturally I can’t speak for Activision or Sony, but it goes without saying that we will vigorously defend ourselves against any claims and whilst it may take a number of months or possibly even years for Jagex to triumph, there is no doubt we will triumph. The accusations will not affect Jagex’s operation in any way nor stop us continuing to create the world’s best online games.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Mark Gerhard[/quote]</p>
<p>I think it was rather rude on his part to say that ambulance chasers are trying to extort money from them.<br>
It’s rich too - as I posted on a topic I made on the Runescape forums, it’s funny how they love sending frivolous DMCA take-down notices to websites like this and the websites of hobbyist programmers and enthusiasts who host Runescape Classic servers. It’s rich to suggest that PalTalk shouldn’t defend their patented software while Jagex should be allowed to harass people.</p>
<p>Jagex have absolutely no integrity. They’re so full of shit that it’s unbelievable.</p>
