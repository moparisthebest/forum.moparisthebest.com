        <p>Moparisthebest, you know as well as everyone else that Click Here doesnt moderate <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> anymore. So, just putting it out there, why is he still part of the staff?</p>
<p>Taharok, ‘cheat clients’ do help the RS2 private <span class="bbcode-i">server</span> field. The client does things it is not supposed to - and its up to the server owner to fix that. Getting rid of the security holes and vulnerabilities is learning, I assume? Well, its definitely a step up from the present. I thought we <span class="bbcode-i">wanted</span> the people here to learn things and be more creative. <span class="bbcode-b">It’s NOT going to happen IF WE DONT push them into doing it.</span></p>
<p>I also agree with the reset on the Dev/Help and MS Question boards. And if possible, the whole forum. I understand and I see where you’re coming from when you regarded this suggestion earlier, but think about it. Before our newly appointed staff for these boards, Ikiliki and occasionally Silab were the only ones who really moderated the forum. It was hard to keep up with the constant rule-breaking. So many posts were made that did not follow the guidelines, and they are still constantly being brought back up from the grave by users. They’re not needed topics anymore - there’s no point. In addition, the users registered here continue to break the rules, thinking that some are not enforced as well as they should be and ignoring the punishments that can be given. If we had an entire forum reset, then we could start clean. Enforce the rules as best as possible - not letting any of the rule-breaking occur, and letting the community know how it’s done from here on out. I dunno, I just felt like commenting on that.</p>
<p>Also, <span class="bbcode-i">why</span> do the forums crash after a ban is made? And <span class="bbcode-i">why</span> would it be so hard to fix?</p>

<p>It’s completely an admin decision to demod Click Here. I do not see anything wrong with him as a person, but he just really doesn’t do anything for MoparScape. If it were me I would ask him if he had anything wrong with being demodded for the good of the site. If he said he was going to start being more active that would be fully ok, but if he realizes that he’s not going to be more active, I think he is a good enough of a person to say yes. However I would leave his vet position, it’s doing no wrong. That’s just my opinion, but I have no control over it. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink1bce.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>As Moparisthebest has said cheat clients are not against the rules as this a cheating community, but I don’t like the factor when someone impersonates azn and posts the client. That’s when we have to draw the line. We can’t overally push them, and I don’t see an overall superb way of doing it, but if you have an idea, I’d post it so we can discuss it.</p>
<p>I don’t really know about a reset of the MoparScape Client Questions Section and Development/Help, but again, as Moparisthebest has stated a reset will not happen again. The only thing that we can do against the factor of people pulling up dead topics is warning/muting them when they do something like that. They should already know that is not allowed, we should not have to tell them.</p>

        <p>If they choose not to follow the rules, they choose to be punished. In the end they will lose, if they want to act like idiots and not read the guidelines/rules stated, then let them be idiots. Only in the end they will lose, and hopefully learn that they should have more respect for things like this.</p>
<p>People don’t realize how much of a life lesson forums like this can be. In any simple job, if you choose not to follow the rules, you choose to receive a punishment. Usually you’ll get a pay cut, or be fired, as you had no respect for the rules, and therefore your boss should have no respect for you. It should be the same way here. Nothing should change that.</p>

        <p>Yes, except this forum is not designed to teach you life lessons. If you want to learn life lessons, go live life. If you want to play MoparScape, come here. And all of these rules just for the sake of having rules are hindering the forum.</p>

        <p>Rules can be enforced all you want, but you will realize that the reality of enforcing rules on a community completely made up of immature teenagers, the end result would be the destruction of the forum.</p>
<p>Why make rules so strict? Strict rules are unneeded. All you need is constantly active moderators (even for a few minutes a night, overall making more moderators necessary) who are willing to enforce those rules word-for-word. Their perception of the rules is also vital for punishments, otherwise a revolt of members could brew up.</p>
<p>And about the life lesson, these are teenagers. Unless they are not normal, they probably don’t dwell too much on life changing things.</p>

<p>True, but honestly, how much clearer can you make “No copy and paste tutorials allowed?” shall we indent it on their brains or something? Because they still aren’t getting it.</p>
