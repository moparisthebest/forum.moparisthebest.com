        <p>I outgrew runescape. I don’t find it fun anymore. I never played it much as a kid because I couldn’t grind for too long, I just liked the fantasy and wonder of it. In eighth grade I started playing runescape properly and grinded. Work all that mess out of my system last summer so I’m pretty much over runescape now.</p>
<p>I joined this site originally cus I wanted to create a server better than ritzscape. I stay on it because… I don’t know why I stay on this site. I have homework to do.</p>

        <p>I’m going to go on a really big ramble here, since mopar and RuneScape has played such a large part of my life and has impacted who I am today in ways I never could of guessed. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> For those impatient readers (tl;dr): I dislike Agility and always have. I feel the skill is too monotonous (The Pit helps a tad) and that the experience is extremely slow in comparison to other skills (only slightly behind fishing and mining, though). As far as the mechanics, I really don’t dislike anything. I prefer the old RuneScape to the new RuneScape because I felt more accomplished in achieving x level rather than now everything is focused on 99 and everything is easier to train. However, I also like this as I have always wanted to be maxed (only thought of it as a dream back then, now it is more of a reality), so I’m not complaining.</p>
<p>I joined this site because someone on a private server me and my irl friends were moderators on posted on the forums about how to create your own private server and they linked to a sticky on mopar. I then found a section called modeling and decided to check it out and I haven’t left here since. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>It is crazy how little choices decide to affect your life in such drastic ways. Sometimes I wonder if it is fate, or just chance. I guess we will never know. A long time ago, back when I was in 3rd grade, I was going to spend the night at my cousin’s house. It turns out he was grounded and was not allowed to play this game called RuneScape. I tried it out on his account and it was pretty cool, but I didn’t like the classic version. He then showed me this new version of RuneScape that was coming out and I really loved it. When I went back to my house I told my parents about this game and asked if I could play. I don’t believe I was ever a non-member, and if I was, it was for only about 2 weeks as my cousin said he couldn’t play and do stuff with me unless I was a member.</p>
<p>Later I started getting friends at school to try and join the game. It is funny because when I registered there was no age limit, yet when I tried getting my friends to try and join they said they weren’t allowed because the game said they had to be over the age of 13 to play. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> It just so happens that I met one of my best friends through this game. One of the guys I wanted to play, who wasn’t that great of a friend in my opinion, decided that he would ride his bike 5 miles to my house (as that was the last year at that school, this was during the summer) through the rain just to come to my house and play RuneScape with me. He was not exactly in the best of shape and the terrain here is quite hilly. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> He has proven to be a great friend of mine, and we are still friends 8 years later. He was the one pushed me to try and start programming (ProtoScape if any of you people browse the server development board :P) and has greatly influenced my life whether he knows it or not. I am now going to consider majoring in either Computer Science or Computer Engineering (possibly double majoring), as I found out how much I like to program/problem solve with computers. I love that feeling I get after solving a bug that has been annoying me for quite some time. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> The topics I find really interesting in CS is topology (because I modeled for such a long time) and memory (in specific 3D Optical Memory), and I have my bestfriend to thank for getting me interested in that field.</p>
<p>So yeah, there’s my life story, where’s yours? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

This site has greatly changed my life, whether or not it’s a good thing I can’t tell yet, but I think it’s a good thing as it really got me more into Java development and that’s what I’m looking to do in my future career.</p>

        <p>Actually the only reason I’m here is because I was involved in the RSC private server community for a while but has since moved on from it and got back into the current RS and started posting mainly in this forum section.</p>

        <p>I started playing RS in September of 2003. I enjoyed the smaller tight-knit community it had and enjoyed the new challenge(because everything about RSC was a difficult and tedious for the most part). Of course that’s now changed as the community is trash. Now as for how I got here, I’ve always been a lazy person, so eventually I got bored with cutting trees and mining rocks so I started using bots. Eventually went to a few cheating sites, stayed at kaitneiks and sythe for a bit. Became a w2 fally rare merchant and sold rares for money on sythe and got pretty active there. Free trade was removed in 07. Pretty much quit.</p>
<p>Used our original IRC so I knew a lot of people already, just used sythe more. Eventually joined MITB because of TR3V0R, got active here because it was 10x more active than sythe. Met some cool people, got some ranks, lost ranks, lost some friends. Still don’t know why I’m here.</p>

        <p>It all began when an old clanmate had told me that he was developing a private server for the clan to play on. After much anticipation to what exactly it was, he told me that he screwed something up and it wouldn’t run anymore. Out of curiosity, I googled RSPS for the first time and found a fun little server called Un-Scape. Quite frankly, I’ve yet to play on a server that could top it, and since it shut down for the first time, I really haven’t played many others since. After its original closing, I wanted more though. I googled RSPS again and stumbled upon the modeling section here. After finding out I could actually make my own weapons and add them into a game (something I had only dreamed of doing), I was hooked. Its thanks to that model section that I’m here <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>As for how I felt about RS… at the time of joining, I was getting bored because there wasn’t too much for me to do. I was bored and didn’t like quests at the time, nor did I have to patience to train for bossing. Since I’ve gotten bored of servers though, I’ve stuck with the original with no complaints.</p>

        <p>My friend told me about a private server which I joined to find out you could get ‘expensive’ items very easily. I was really exited when I got a party hat until I found out it was only 10gp… Then I got a guthans spear and sold it for a million GP. I was so happy, that I even asked a few people how to get that money onto the real game (They all laughed at me :L). From there I was addicted to private servers and eventually became an owner myself. Now I just don’t bother, and play RuneScape a lot more again as most servers nowadays are awful.</p>

        <p>The problem I had with Runescape was that it didn’t accept SMS-payment from Norway at that time. Now I just find it boring, with a very flawed combat design, and EoC doesn’t really help it.</p>

        <p>Because of the partyhats and stuff like that, I had a very hard time making a lot of money back then on real RS to afford anything good so I turned to private servers. Other than that I don’t see anything wrong with the game before or today (except the goldfarmers problem).</p>

        <p>My friend got me into silab servers, then discovered normal servers with a friend when silab died, then started rsps when I saw sagi started his own (we both played rovascape).<br>
Started with friends and this is how I’m here today.</p>
<p>I dislike many things about Rs but what entised me into RSPs was that I liked being able to achieve a lot more in a RSPS in a shorter time frame. I only play spawn pks and proper Rs now though.<br>
A lot of the time when I play an eco I can see how badly things are done and it just puts me off and thats my story:).</p>
