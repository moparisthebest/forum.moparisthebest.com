        <p>Hey this is my first tutorial so yeah <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Here goes!!</p>
<p>Files used: NPCHandler.java, client.java<br>
Difficulty: 3/10</p>
<p>Okay first off your going to want to choose the creatures you wish to use for slayer. My reccommended creatures are as follows:<br>
90 - Skeletons<br>
1616 - Basilisks<br>
1615 - Abyssal Demons<br>
2783 - Dark Beasts</p>
<p>That should be enough to start you off. You can add more very very easily and you will learn how to later on <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Adding the slayer tasks.</span></p>
<p>Go to client.java<br>
do ctrl + f and search lowtask OR (if that doesn’t work) task<br>
wait until you see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> public int[] lowTask = { 90, 1616};
 public int[] mediumTask = { 90, 1624};
 public int[] highTask = {1624, 1615};
 public int taskID = -1;
 public int taskAmount = -1;</code></pre>
<p>Explanation:<br>
the tasks are basically what the player gets set…pretty simple…there are 3 different task types NORMALLY but you can create your own. I will show you how to at the end (in the extras).</p>
<p>Now as you probably guessed the numbers in the {     } bits are the creatures you get set as slayer tasks.</p>
<p>public int[] lowTask = { 90, 1616};<br>
public int[] mediumTask = { 90, 1624};<br>
public int[] highTask = {1624, 1615};<br>
public int taskID = -1;<br>
public int taskAmount = -1;</p>
<p>this means that you can get skeletons and basilisks for low tasks, skeletons and dust devils for mediumtasks and dus devils and abyssal demons for hightasks.</p>
<p>to choose your own monsters just put their id’s in the {     } bits and then save your client but don’t close it…yet.</p>
<p>Setting levels.</p>
<p>So you may want to set a level…like people with level 10 slayer getting set Abyssal Demons for slayer tasks wouldn’t be good. To do this you need to search for the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> public void giveTask</code></pre>
<p>This is normally AFTER the part where you set your creatures.<br>
Now in my source this is how its set up:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> public void giveTask() 
 {
  if (playerLevel[18] &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; playerLevel[18] &lt;= 65) {
   taskID = randomLowTask();
   taskAmount = 15;
   talk2("Your task is to kill "+taskAmount+" "+GetNpcName(taskID)+"s.", "", 1599);
  }
  if (playerLevel[18] &gt;= 65 &amp;&amp; playerLevel[18] &lt;= 80) {
   taskID = randomMediumTask();
   taskAmount = 20;
   talk2("Your task is to kill "+taskAmount+" "+GetNpcName(taskID)+"s.", "", 1599);
  }
  if (playerLevel[18] &gt;= 80) {
   taskID = randomHighTask();
   taskAmount = 30;
   talk2("Your task is to kill "+taskAmount+" "+GetNpcName(taskID)+"s.", "", 1599);
  }
 }</code></pre>
<p>Explained:<br>
The first bit you see [if (playerLevel[18] &gt;=1] is basically saying you have to have a slayer level higher than one to recieve this task but then the following [&amp;&amp; playerLevel[18] &lt;= 65)] means that the max slayer level a player can have to recieve these tasks is 65. Simple code used pretty much all over the source-code.</p>
<p>The next bit [ taskID = ] is basically telling the client that it has to use that particular slayer task set. e.g. randomhightask would link back to the creature ID’s for hightask and so on.</p>
<p>The next bit [taskAmount = ] is saying how many you can get in that particular task. There are other ways of doing this. For example you could put in taskAmount = 10 + misc.random(40); This would tell the client that it has to have a minimum of 10 for a task but a maximum of 40 for a task…so basically a random number of creatures for a task. By changing the (40) you could set that to whatever you want…for example:<br>
taskAmount = 100 + misc.random(400);<br>
That would be minimum 100 and maximum 400. You get the point?</p>
<p>The final bit of code [talk2("Your task is to kill “+taskAmount+” "+GetNpcName(taskID)+“s.”, “”, 1599);] is telling the player what their task is. “+taskAmount+” is…well…their task amount. and the “+GetNpcName(taskID)+” is the name of the NPC or creature.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Setting the levels needed to kill creatures</span></p>
<p>Okay now your not going to want level one to kill everything in your server as you might want to set decent drops for more monsters and here is how to do it!</p>
<p>Search for:<br>
if (type ==</p>
<p>Something like this should show:</p>
<pre><code>	if (type == 1616) {
		if (playerLevel[18] &gt; 1) {
			sM("You must be level 1 slayer or higher to attack this monster.");
			ResetAttackNPC();
			return false;
</code></pre>
<p>If not, look around the client.java for something like this as this is crucial to this part of the tutorial.</p>
<p>Explanation:<br>
if (type == 1616) {<br>
This means the NPC id…so this particular one is for Basilisks.</p>
<p>if (playerLevel[18] &gt; 1) {<br>
This is the level needed to kill the monster. So the player needs higher than one slayer to kill this NPC.</p>
<p>sM(“You must be level 1 slayer or higher to attack this monster.”);<br>
This is what the player recieves if they don’t have the sufficient level to kill this NPC.</p>
<p>ResetAttackNPC();<br>
return false;<br>
I must be honest i do not know what this does! But it IS needed so DO NOT delete it.</p>
<p>Okay to add something like a Dust Devil to this your going to want to change the if (type == 1616) { to<br>
if (type == 1624) {. Once this is done move onto the level that the player requires to kill it. Change this: if (playerLevel[18] &gt; 1) {  to this  if (playerLevel[18] &gt; 64) {. This is basically the same as if (playerLevel[18] &gt;= 65) { But just a simpler way of writing it.<br>
Now finally change this:<br>
sM(“You must be level 1 slayer or higher to attack this monster.”);<br>
To this:<br>
sM(“You must be level 65 slayer or higher to attack this monster.”);</p>
<p>And your done! Thats all of client.java done so now to move onto an equally important bit.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Almost there!<br>
Making sure the player actually gets experience for killing the creature!</span><br>
You can save and close the client.java now <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Okay.<br>
Go to NpcHandler.java and search for</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (npcs[i].npcType</code></pre>
<p>There should be some sort of code below that, if not keep looking for it.<br>
It should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">}
if (npcs[i].npcType == 87 &amp;&amp; temp.taskID == 87) {
temp.addSkillXP(1500, 18);
temp.taskAmount -= 1;
if (temp.taskAmount == 0 || temp.taskAmount == 1) {
temp.taskID = -1;
temp.taskAmount = -1;
temp.sM("You have completed your task. Talk to Vannaka to get a new one.");
}</code></pre>
<p>Okay i’m going to tell you what to do here then explain it. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
First of all, remember the NPC id’s that you used as your task-sets earlier…1624, 1616, 1615 etc.<br>
Now depending on the groups you put them in your going to want to set the Experience correspondingly so here is an example for you. For dust devils which are…on average level 65 Slayer to kill.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">}
if (npcs[i].npcType == 1624 &amp;&amp; temp.taskID == 1624) {
temp.addSkillXP(15600, 18);
temp.taskAmount -= 1;
if (temp.taskAmount == 0 || temp.taskAmount == 1) {
temp.taskID = -1;
temp.taskAmount = -1;
temp.sM("You have completed your task. Talk to Duradel to get a new one.");
}</code></pre>
<p>Not much difference from the first example huh? Thats because adding slayer tasks like this is much simpler than everyone thinks. Now to do the others you can copy and paste that all down then change the experience rates and NPC ID’s. You may also notice that i have changed the slayer master. This is because i find on many sources Duradel is the easiest master.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (npcs[i].npcType == 1624 &amp;&amp; temp.taskID == 1624) {</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty straight forward. It is the NPC ID. make sure you change BOTH of these!! This is critical to your player getting the correct experience.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">temp.addSkillXP(15600, 18);</code></pre>
<p>This is the experience the player will gain for killing it. the 15600 is the experience and the 18 is the level. Obviously you can change it if you were doing another skill but this is a slayer Tutorial!</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">temp.taskAmount -= 1;</code></pre>
<p>This tells the client to deduct a creature from your slayer task total.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (temp.taskAmount == 0 || temp.taskAmount == 1) {
temp.taskID = -1;
temp.taskAmount = -1;
temp.sM("You have completed your task. Talk to Duradel to get a new one.");</code></pre>
<p>This basically all works together. The first bit is checking to see if you are done, then the two other bits are telling the client you are done then the final bit is actually telling the player that your task is complete.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EXTRA’S</span><br>
Setting extra Slayer Task options<br>
Okay so your getting a bit bored of the current task set and you have a couple of really good Slayers on your server who want something different!<br>
Heres how to do this:<br>
Open Client.java<br>
First of all do ctrl + f and type in lowtask, just as if your adding the NPC’s to your task-set.<br>
You should get something like this again:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> public int[] lowTask = { 90, 1616};
 public int[] mediumTask = { 90, 1624};
 public int[] highTask = {1624, 1615};
 public int taskID = -1;
 public int taskAmount = -1;</code></pre>
<p>Now just add in here the following line of code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public int[] extremeTask = { 2783, 50 };</code></pre>
<p>This is saying that there is an extremtask! which could be for people with slayer levels of upto 99!<br>
The task-set i have set is Dark Beasts and King Black Dragons.<br>
Don’t close and compile yet, theres still alot to do!<br>
Scroll down from that until you see</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
	public int randomHighTask() 
	{
		return highTask[(int) (Math.random() * highTask.length)];
	}</code></pre>
<p>Okay cop that code (with BOTH brackets) and paste it directly below, so it looks alligned with everything else.<br>
Then change HighTask to extremetask.<br>
It should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public int randomExtremeTask()
	{
		return extremeTask[(int) (Math.random() * extremeTask.length)];
	}</code></pre>
<p>Explanation:<br>
This is basically telling the client that there is a task called extremetask and that it should imply it.</p>
<p>Setting the level requirements for the task:<br>
do ctrl + f and search for</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void giveTask()</code></pre>
<p>Then scroll down to:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		}
		if (playerLevel[18] &gt;= 81) {
			taskID = randomHighTask();
			taskAmount = 10 + misc.random(40);
			talk2("Your task is to kill "+taskAmount+" "+GetNpcName(taskID)+"s.", "", 1599);
		}</code></pre>
<p>Then underneath that copy and paste this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		if (playerLevel[18] &gt;= 90) {
			taskID = randomExtremeTask();
			taskAmount = 10 + misc.random(40);
			talk2("Your task is to kill "+taskAmount+" "+GetNpcName(taskID)+"s.", "", 1599);
		}
	}</code></pre>
<p>I’m not going to explain these as i did before.<br>
Your overall code should look a bit like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public void giveTask() 
	{
		if (playerLevel[18] &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; playerLevel[18] &lt;= 50) {
			taskID = randomLowTask();
			taskAmount = 10 + misc.random(40);
			talk2("Your task is to kill "+taskAmount+" "+GetNpcName(taskID)+"s.", "", 1599);
		}
		if (playerLevel[18] &gt;= 51 &amp;&amp; playerLevel[18] &lt;= 80) {
			taskID = randomMediumTask();
			taskAmount = 10 + misc.random(40);
			talk2("Your task is to kill "+taskAmount+" "+GetNpcName(taskID)+"s.", "", 1599);
		}
		if (playerLevel[18] &gt;= 81) {
			taskID = randomHighTask();
			taskAmount = 10 + misc.random(40);
			talk2("Your task is to kill "+taskAmount+" "+GetNpcName(taskID)+"s.", "", 1599);
		}
		if (playerLevel[18] &gt;= 90) {
			taskID = randomExtremeTask();
			taskAmount = 10 + misc.random(40);
			talk2("Your task is to kill "+taskAmount+" "+GetNpcName(taskID)+"s.", "", 1599);
		}
	}</code></pre>
<p>And that is it!<br>
I will make a simple tutorial on Slayer Drops but for now i hope this helped!<br>
Please comment on improvements i could have done…but i hope it helped.<br>
I hope it was a decent first tutorial by me. there will be more to come!!<br>
Thanks for reading.</p>

        <p>Idea. I never really thought about adding a new task set, but you could also add to the NPC Dialogue this:</p>
<p>“Pick Normal Task”<br>
“Extreme Task (Once per day)”</p>
<p>If you had a 1x per day task (with partially rare drops that require slayer, I guess?), people might be encouraged to do slayer more?</p>
