Cigarettes cost the nation over $100 Billion per year in health costs!<br>
Tobacco companies spend over $4 billion a year promoting their deadly product<br>
1.3 Million people quit smoking each year, but about 48 Million continue to smoke<br>
Tobacco is often the first drug used by young people, who then go on and use alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs!!</p>
<p>How The Economy Can Benefit Off Of Marijuana Being Legal:<br>
The United States will flourish if marijuana is legal, even though there are many different strands of marijuana<br>
there can be a flat tax for all of them just like how there is with onions, apples, carrots, lettuce etc… Just look at<br>
any food produce that can be grown, thats the same for marijuana, we can sell marijuana in stores, such as gas stations,<br>
medical facilities, drug stores, almost any local store. Marijuana is just like any produce you can grow it you can sell it<br>
there shouldn’t be a law against growing it or using it, it can benefit the whole country by it being legal, more than half<br>
of the United States does marijuana illegally. If marijuana was legal we wouldn’t have to spend money on housing inmates in jail<br>
the average inmate costs $94.87, when you could just keep them out of jail. Just think how much money the whole country would save<br>
if marijuana was legal, lets say 1500000 people go to jail for marijuana a year, for them to stay just one day thats $142,305,000!<br>
Now if we didn’t put them in jail for marijuana thats $142,305,000 more to spend on education, roads, medical etc. The government is<br>
wasting money on putting people in jail for having marijuana, people who do marijuana just wanna do marijuana they<br>
don’t wanna bother anyone else. If marijuana was legal there would be less crimes over drugs, because people could just go to the store<br>
and buy it instead of having to hide from the law to deal their drugs to get money under the table. When the government can just sell it<br>
by gram, ounces, pounds etc. Anyways marijuana is less lethal than any other drugs out there like cigarettes, alcohol if you compare all the<br>
data I collected you will find that marijuana is less dangerous than all of the others. If the U.S. is afraid of losing money they could just tax<br>
it like how I said, and more money will come in, because if you think about it marijuana is just like apples, apples you can grow legally then you can<br>
eat them without paying tax to the government, so marijuana you can grow and use it without getting taxed by the government so if marijuana isn’t legal because<br>
of that reason then what makes apples legal?</p>

        <p>[quote=“zammyking111, post:4, topic:272186”]You can’t ban em all because if you ban em all, more people will go to jail and as i found out it costs $94.87 a day to house an inmate, well in the state of Florida that is.</p>
<p>And seriously if your gonna post useless comments and being a dick about it, just go /cut wrist and don’t post on this thread.[/quote]<br>
Don’t put them into jail but give them a fine, and disallow sale and import of it.</p>
