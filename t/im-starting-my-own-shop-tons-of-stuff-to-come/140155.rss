    <description>Hey,

     I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m really good when it comes to things like clothing saying ideas, or things like that. I write books in my spare time, or when bored, and I&#39;ve had more than one person tell me that I should think about opening a custom clothing shop when I get some cash. Well, some friends have convinced me to check out Cafepress.com, and I think it&#39;s a great idea. The idea of it, is to make your own clothes, and then sell them to people, with no cost to you. Amazing right? I would really like to shake the guys million dollar hand who thought of this, it&#39;s genius. 

Well, now I&#39;ve started my own. It&#39;s got nothing yet, but I&#39;m brainstorming some ideas, and making other things in photoshop right this second. I know that people have done this before, but this to me is different. I not only want to make my own things, but I want other people to join me. If you can come up with some ideas, not only will I give complete credit, but give all profits to you if sold.

I know that this offer isn&#39;t very intriguing since no one even knows my shop name, but if I were to get big, anyone that stuck with me would get benefited a lot more than people that showed up before I got big.

I know this sounds like a pipe dream, but I&#39;m really into this, so please think about it. I&#39;m really into this.

Thanks for reading,

Buzzy</description>
