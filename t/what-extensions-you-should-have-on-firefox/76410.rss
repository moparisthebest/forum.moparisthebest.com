    <description>[center]----- Adblock Plus -----[/center]
[hr]
Description:
Right-click on a banner and choose &quot;Adblock&quot; from the context menu - the banner won&#39;t be downloaded again. Maybe even replace parts of the banner address with star symbols to block similar banners as well. Or you select a filter subscription when Adblock Plus starts up the first time, then even this simple task will usually be unnecessary: the filter subscription will block most advertisements fully automatically.

Description:
Winner of the &quot;2006 PC World World Class Award&quot;, this tool provides extra protection to your Firefox.
It allows JavaScript, Java and other executable content to run only from trusted domains of your choice, e.g. your home-banking web site, and guards the &quot;trust boundaries&quot; against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS).
Such a preemptive approach prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known and even unknown!) with no loss of functionality...
Experts do agree: Firefox is really safer with NoScript ;-)

Description:<br>
Right-click on a banner and choose “Adblock” from the context menu - the banner won’t be downloaded again. Maybe even replace parts of the banner address with star symbols to block similar banners as well. Or you select a filter subscription when Adblock Plus starts up the first time, then even this simple task will usually be unnecessary: the filter subscription will block most advertisements fully automatically.</p>

[center]----- NoScript -----[/center]<br>
[hr]<br>
Description:<br>
Winner of the “2006 PC World World Class Award”, this tool provides extra protection to your Firefox.<br>
It allows JavaScript, Java and other executable content to run only from trusted domains of your choice, e.g. your home-banking web site, and guards the “trust boundaries” against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS).<br>
Such a preemptive approach prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known and even unknown!) with no loss of functionality…<br>
Experts do agree: Firefox is really safer with NoScript <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
