    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-heard-that-pplsuqbawlz-programmed-his-bytecode-library/108758</link>
    <description>A week ago I looked for the original post boasting the blistering speed at which ppsuqbawlz&#39;s bytecode library was both written and functions, it would seem that it has been deleted, needless to say I was heart broken.

This post is meant to be all in good fun!


I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library with all of his fingers broken.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library in binary.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library using a [url=http://unix.rulez.org/~calver/pictures/supercoder.jpg]supercoder keyboard[/url] with half of the keys missing.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library on an abacus.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library in the amount of time it took to submit this topic.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library while itching his cisterna magna cerebellomedularis.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library using an industrial sized magnet on his tower.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library while his power cable was unplugged.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library faster than Chuck Norris would round house kick you in the face.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library with two broken arms and no monitor.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library with On Screen Keyboard with a broken mouse.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library in 30 minutes just using his nose.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library while splitting an atom with his eyelashes.
I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library with using Microsoft&#39;s speech recognition, without a microphone.


If you have your own you would like added, just post them, if they are deemed appropriate I will add them to the list

okay, incase you havent caught on, you are meant to finish the sentence &quot;I heard that pplsuqbawlz programmed his bytecode library...&quot; with some outlandish claim, similar to those of chuck norris or the stig</description>
