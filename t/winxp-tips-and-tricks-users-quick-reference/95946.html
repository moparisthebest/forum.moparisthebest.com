<p>Network Access After Norton Anti-Virus Install</p>
<p>Sometimes you can’t access a WinXP computer after installing Norton Anti-Virus.<br>
There might be a variety of errors at the other computer depending on the operating system.<br>
On the XP computer, in the Event Viewer / System log, there will be the following error:<br>
The server’s configuration parameter “irpstacksize” is too small for the server to use a local device.<br>
Start Regedit<br>
Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Servic es\lanmanserver\parameters<br>
Edit the IRPStackSize<br>
Give it a value of 15<br>
Reboot the computer</p>
<p>Configure for Auto-Logon</p>
<p>If you are the only person using the computer and what to have it automatically log you on,<br>
Start / Run / “control userpasswords2” - no quotes<br>

Services You Can Disable<br>
There are quite a few services you can disable from starting automatically.<br>
This would be to speed up your boot time and free resources.<br>
They are only suggestions so I suggestion you read the description of each one when you run Services<br>
and that you turn them off one at a time.<br>
Some possibilities are:<br>
Alerter - Sends alert messages to specified users that are connected to the server computer.<br>
Application Management - Allows software to tap directly into the Add/Remove Programs feature via the Windows Installer technology.<br>
Background Intelligent Transfer Service - The Background Intelligent Transfer service is used by programs (such as Windows AutoUpdate) to download files by using spare bandwidth.<br>
Clipbook - ClipBook permits you to cut and paste text and graphics over the network.<br>
Error Reporting Service - Allows applications to send error reports to Microsoft in the event of an application fault.<br>
Fast User Switching - Windows XP allows users to switch quickly between accounts, without requiring them to log off.<br>
Help and Support - Allows the XP Built-in Help and Support Center to run.<br>

Indexing Service - Indexes contents and properties of files on local and remote computers; provides rapid access to files through flexible querying language.<br>
IP SEC - Manages IP security policy and starts the ISAKMP/Oakley (IKE) and the IP security driver. If you are not on a domain, you likely don’t need this running.<br>
Messenger - Transmits net send and Alerter service messages between clients and servers. This is how a lot of pop-up windows start appearing on your desktop.<br>
Net Logon - Supports pass-through authentication of account logon events for computers in a domain. If you are not on a domain, you don’t need this running<br>
Network DDE - Provides network transport and security for Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) for programs running on the same computer or on different computers.<br>
NT LM Security Support Provider - Provides security to remote procedure call (RPC) programs that use transports other than named pipes.<br>
Performance Logs and Alerts - Collects performance data from local or remote computers based on preconfigured schedule parameters, then writes the data to a log or triggers an alert. If you don’t need to monitor your performance logs, then you don’t need this service.<br>
Portable Media Serial Number - Retrieves the serial number of any portable music player connected to your computer<br>
QOS RSVP - Provides network signaling and local traffic control setup functionality for QoS-aware programs and control applets.<br>
Remote Desktop Help Session Manager - Manages and controls Remote Assistance. If you are not using Remote Desktop you don’t need this service.<br>

Smart Card Helper - Enables support for legacy non-plug and play smart-card readers used by this computer.<br>
SSDP Discovery Service - Enables discovery of UPnP devices on your home network.<br>
TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper - Enables support for NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) service and NetBIOS name resolution. This should not be needed in today’s network environment.<br>
Telnet - Enables a remote user to log on to this computer and run programs, and supports various TCP/IP Telnet clients.<br>
Uninterruptible Power Supply Service - Manages an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to the computer.<br>

WMI Performance Adapter - Provides performance library information from WMI HiPerf providers.</p>
<p>Cleaning the Prefetch Directory</p>
<p>WindowsXP has a new feature called Prefetch. This keeps a shortcut to recently used programs.<br>
However it can fill up with old and obsolete programs.<br>
To clean this periodically go to:<br>
Star / Run / Prefetch<br>
Press Ctrl-A to highlight all the shorcuts<br>
Delete them</p>
<p>Not Displaying Logon, Logoff, Startup and Shutdown Status Messages</p>
<p>To turn these off:<br>
Start Regedit<br>
Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Curr entVersion\policies\system<br>
If it is not already there, create a DWORD value named DisableStatusMessages<br>
Give it a value of 1</p>
<p>Repair Install</p>
<p>If XP is corrupted to the point where none of the previous solutions get it to boot,<br>
you can do a Repair Install that might work as well as keep the current settings.<br>
Make sure you have your valid WindowsXP key.<br>
The whole process takes about half an hour depending on your computer<br>
If you are being prompted for the administrator’s password, you need to choose the 2nd repair option, not the first.<br>
Insert and boot from your WindowsXP CD<br>
At the second R=Repair option, press the R key<br>
This will start the repair<br>
Press F8 for I Agree at the Licensing Agreement<br>
Press R when the directory where WindowsXP is installed is shown. Typically this is C:\WINDOWS<br>
It will then check the C: drive and start copying files<br>
It will automatically reboot when needed. Keep the CD in the drive.<br>
You will then see the graphic part of the repair that is like during a normal install of XP (Collecting Information, Dynamic Update, Preparing Installation, Installing Windows, Finalizing Installation)<br>
When prompted, click on the Next button<br>
When prompted, enter your XP key<br>
Normally you will want to keep the same Workgroup or Domain name<br>
The computer will reboot<br>
Then you will have the same screens as a normal XP Install<br>
Activate if you want (usually a good idea)<br>
Register if you want (but not necessary)<br>
Finish<br>
At this point you should be able to log in with any existing accounts.</p>
<p>NTOSKRNL Missing or Corrupt</p>
<p>If you get an error that NTOSKRNL not found:<br>
Insert and boot from your WindowsXP CD.<br>
At the first R=Repair option, press the R key<br>
Press the number that corresponds to the correct location for the installation of Windows you want to repair.<br>
Typically this will be <span class="hashtag">#1</span><br>
Change to the drive that has the CD ROM.<br>
CD i386<br>
expand ntkrnlmp.ex_ C:\Windows\System32\ntoskrnl.exe<br>
If WindowsXP is installed in a different location, just make the necessary change to C:\Windows<br>
Take out the CD ROM and type exit</p>
<p>HAL.DLL Missing or Corrupt</p>
<p>If you get an error regarding a missing or corrupt hal.dll file, it might simply be the BOOT.INI file on the root of the C: drive that is misconfigured<br>
Insert and boot from your WindowsXP CD.<br>
At the first R=Repair option, press the R key<br>
Press the number that corresponds to the correct location for the installation of Windows you want to repair.<br>
Typically this will be <span class="hashtag">#1</span><br>
Type bootcfg /list to show the current entries in the BOOT.INI file<br>
Type bootcfg /rebuild to repair it<br>
Take out the CD ROM and type exit</p>

Just boot with a Win98 floppy and copy the NTLDR or <a href="http://ntdetect.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">NTDETECT.COM</a> files<br>

Save and Close the file. Change the extension to js and your got it.<br>
You can make a shortcut to that file to make it easy to shut down your system.</p>
<p>Hiding the Last User Logged On</p>
<p>If you use the standard NT style of login and want to hide the last user:<br>
Start the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc)<br>
Go to Computer Configuration / Windows Settings / Security Settings / Local Policies / Security Options<br>
Scroll down to Interactive logon: Do not display last user name<br>
Set it to Enable</p>
<p>Poweroff at Shutdown</p>
<p>If your computer does not turn off the power when doing a shutdown,<br>
you may need to edit the registry. I have all the correct BIOS and Power settings and still needed to do this.<br>
Start Regedit<br>
Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop<br>
Edit the key PowerOffActive and give it a value of 1<br>
You can do the same in HKEY_USERS.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Desktop</p>
<p>Remembering Folder Settings</p>
<p>If XP does not remember your folder settings, delete or rename the following registry keys<br>
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell NoRoam\BagMRU]<br>
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell NoRoam\Bags]</p>
<p>Preventing Applications from Stealing the Focus</p>

Start Regedit<br>
Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows \ CurrentVersion \ Policies \ Explorer <br>
Create a new DWORD Value<br>
Give it the name NoSharedDocuments<br>
Give it a value of 1<br>
Log off or reboot</p>
<p>Removing Thumbs.db Files</p>
<p>When viewing a folder with the Thumbnail view, WindowsXP creates a thumbs.db file.<br>
This is a cache of the current pictures in that directory.<br>
If you want to turn this feature off and save a little disk space<br>
Start the Windows Explorer<br>
Go to Tools / Folder Options / View<br>
In the first section under Files and Folders, check Do not cache thumbnails<br>
Now you can search for the thumbs.db file on your computer and remove them. No more should be created.</p>
<p>Enable / Disable the Task Manager</p>
<p>Start Regedit<br>
Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Curre ntVersion\Policies\System<br>
Create the Dword value DisableTaskMgr<br>
Give it a value of 0 to enable it<br>
Give it a vaule of 1 to disable it</p>
<p>Clearing the Page File on Shutdown</p>
<p>Another way to set the computer to clear the pagefile without directly editing the registry is:<br>
Click on the Start button<br>
Go to the Control Panel<br>
Administrative Tools<br>
Local Security Policy<br>
Local Policies<br>
Click on Security Options<br>
Right hand menu - right click on “Shutdown: Clear Virtual Memory Pagefile”<br>
Select “Enable”<br>
Reboot<br>
If you want to clear the page file on each shutdown:<br>
Start Regedit<br>
Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Contro l\Session Manager\Memory Management\ClearPageFileAtShutdown<br>
Set the value to 1</p>
<p>No GUI Boot</p>
<p>If you don’t need to see the XP boot logo,<br>
Run MSCONFIG<br>
Click on the BOOT.INI tab<br>
Check the box for /NOGUIBOOT</p>
<p>Using the Classic Search in Explorer</p>
<p>If you prefer to use the classic search style in Explorer,<br>
Start Regedit<br>
Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Curre ntVersion\Explorer\CabinetState<br>
Add a String Key called Use Search Asst<br>
Give it a value of no</p>
<p>Changing Drive Letters</p>
<p>If you want to change the letters assigned to your fixed or removable drives:<br>
Right Click on My Computer<br>
Select Manage<br>
Select Disk Management<br>
For a Fixed Disk:<br>
Select it<br>
Right click<br>
Select Change Drive Letter and Path<br>
Click on the Edit button<br>
Enter in the letter you want to use<br>
For a Removable Disk:<br>
In the lower, right hand panel, right click on the Disk or CD ROM #<br>
Select Change Drive Letter and Path<br>
Click on the Edit button<br>
Enter in the letter you want to use</p>
<p>Changing the Registered Owner</p>
<p>Start Regedit<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion<br>
From there you can edit the name in the Registered Owner key</p>
<p>Decreasing Boot Time</p>
<p>Microsoft has made available a program to analyze and decrease the time it takes to boot to WindowsXP<br>
The program is called BootVis<br>
Uncompress the file.<br>
Run BOOTVIS.EXE<br>
For a starting point, run Trace / Next Boot + Driver Delays<br>
This will reboot your computer and provide a benchmark<br>
After the reboot, BootVis will take a minute or two to show graphs of your system startup.<br>
Note how much time it takes for your system to load (click on the red vertical line)<br>
Then run Trace / Optimize System<br>
Re-Run the Next Boot + Drive Delays<br>
Note how much the time has decreased<br>
Mine went from approximately 39 to 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Hide/Unhide Logon Names</p>
<p>If you want to hide or unhide the names of users that are displayed on the initial logon screen:<br>
Start Regedit<br>
Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Windows NT \ CurrentVersion \ Winlogon \ SpecialAccounts \ UserList<br>
Add a DWORD with the name of the user account you want to hide<br>
Make sure it has a value of 0<br>
If there is an existing account, you can unhide it by giving it a value of 1</p>
<p>WindowsXP Command Line Utilities</p>
<p>While there are a lot of command line utilities in WindowsXP, here are some that I have been using lately.<br>
bootcfg - Configures, queries, or changes Boot.ini file settings.<br>
driverquery - Displays a list of all installed device drivers and their properties.<br>
getmac - Returns the media access control (MAC) address and list of network protocols associated with each address for all network cards in each computer<br>
gpresult - Displays Group Policy settings and Resultant Set of Policy (RSOP) for a user or a computer<br>
netsh - You can use commands in the Netsh Interface IP context to configure the TCP/IP protocol<br>
schtasks - Schedules commands and programs to run periodically or at a specific time<br>
systeminfo - Displays detailed configuration information about a computer and its operating system</p>
<p>Disabling Hibernation</p>
<p>If you don’t want to use up the disk space taken by Hibernation, or don’t need to use it at all,<br>
you can easily disable it.<br>
Open up the Control Panel / Power Options icon<br>
Click on the Hibernation icon<br>
Uncheck Enable Hibernation</p>
<p>Increasing System Performance</p>
<p>If you have 512 megs or more of memory, you can increase system performance<br>
by having the core system kept in memory.<br>
Start Regedit<br>
Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Contro l\Session Manager\Memory Management\DisablePagingExecutive<br>
Set the value to be 1<br>
Reboot the computer</p>
<p>Common Command Console Utilities</p>
<p>WindowsXP comes with quite a few console utilities you can easily run from the command line:<br>
Computer Management - compmgmt.msc<br>
Disk Managment - diskmgmt.msc<br>
Device Manager - devmgmt.msc<br>
Disk Defrag - dfrg.msc<br>
Event Viewer - eventvwr.msc<br>
Shared Folders - fsmgmt.msc<br>
Group Policies - gpedit.msc<br>
Local Users and Groups - lusrmgr.msc<br>
Performance Monitor - perfmon.msc<br>
Resultant Set of Policies - rsop.msc<br>
Local Security Settings - secpol.msc<br>
Services - services.msc<br>
Component Services - comexp.msc</p>
<p>Automatically Ending Non-Responsive Tasks</p>
<p>Start Regedit<br>
Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\AutoEndTasks<br>
Set the value to be 1<br>
In the same section, change the WaitToKillAppTimeout to the number of milliseconds you want.</p>
<p>Changing Programs That Start Automatically</p>
<p>WindowsXP has a similar program, MSCONFIG, that was available in Windows98.<br>
This allows you to view and change what programs are automatically started each time you log in.<br>
The new version also allows you to view and edit the boot.ini file (as well as check for errors and use several advanced switches)</p>
<p>Creating an Automated Install of WindowsXP</p>
<p>On the WindowsXP CP, in the SUPPORT\TOOLS directory,<br>
there is a file called DEPLOY.CAB.<br>
Extract the programs DEPLOY.CHM (help file) and SETUPMGR.EXE (main program)<br>
Run SETUPMGR and answer the prompts.<br>
This will create both a unattend.bat and unattend.txt file you can use for automated installs.<br>
Note: The batch file might need some minor modification for file locations but it is fairly basic.</p>
