        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have been scammed by TimeRS today, and I tough I have to warn you for this scammer. He have scammed me for 60 euros for his new v2 source.</p>
<p>He was online at his own server and I talked to timebroken, he said to me that he will give me the source for 60 euros.<br>
I have added him on skype and booked the 60 euros to it. He said that I had to wait 4 hours in case for fraud, after the 4 hours he sent it to me.<br>
After the 4 hours I did not receive any pm. I started a conversation with him and he told a bullshit story that his account was hacked. Three accounts of him was hacked his Skype, Server account, and his moparscape account was hacked.</p>
<p>Don’t trust this guy, he is one big scammer.</p>
<p>For more information I have all pictures.</p>
