Asus could have been forgiven for putting in components created for a desktop Computer system as a way to make it more rapidly, but has properly opted for laptop-oriented components that advertise an improved balance of battery existence and speed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Storage room is akin to that of a genuine Lamborghini -- honest to middling.
