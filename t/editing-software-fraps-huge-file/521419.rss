    <title>Editing Software + fraps huge file?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/editing-software-fraps-huge-file/521419</link>
    <description>Recently I bought a gaming computer and I often make videos so I need some software for windows because I automatically had iMovie on my macbook.

I tried 2 free programs but they were horrible. Then I tried the Sony Vegas 12 trial but they had a watermark every now and then. Does anyone know of software that is either insanely cheap or free and pretty good? I only need it to render in HD 1080p and trim clips a little bit.

Google has been no help so far :(
And I would consider a torrent but I don&#39;t want to get a virus on my brand new computer lol



EDIT: Okay, and I did like a 10 minute video with fraps on minecraft, and the file size was like 36GB. Something seems very wrong about that. I was recording my mic too but it shouldn&#39;t be that big at all. I would have to record my xbox for like 15 hours for 36GB...

And a 15 second video was like 600MB lol</description>

Dxtory should overall have a less performance hit because it’s putting most of the work on the hard drive instead.</p>
<p>Here’s some of my settings:<br>
Codec: Dxtory video codec (YUV410, with compression on)<br>
Framerate: 29.97<br>
Scaling: 100%<br>
(these are pretty much default)</p>
<p>Make sure you have Synchronize Video FPS unticked unless you want to play at 30fps. There’s also many videos on YouTube that give their own settings and whatnot.</p>

Well I would buy DXTory for better compression which would mean quicker uploads, but I just purchased fraps <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> I figured that was what most people use but there’s no way with these file sizes after compression.

You should be using something along the lines of Sony Vegas for rendering your footage. A bit rate of 6-10Mbps is pretty much enough and the file sizes won’t be massive.</p>
<p>I have three 15 minute 1080p videos right here with an average file size of 1.57gb. They were rendered with a bit rate of 15Mbps so if you use 6-10, the file sizes are going to be a lot smaller.</p>
<p>The procurement of the software is up to you. Just use common sense and get a decent antivirus.<br>

I’ve been doing 30fps which does cut it down slightly, but it still gave me the file sizes in the above post.<br>

Yes, you’re going to get large files with any game recording software and the only way to combat it is to compress it. Fraps records in somewhat lossless quality with few ways to reduce file sizes. One thing you can do is record in half size, which isn’t the greatest solution. Fraps is quite outdated and has been lacking many useful features for years, which is why most people have moved onto different means of recording.</p>
<p>DXTory offers many compression options and you can customize how the footage scales. As mentioned in my previous post, the performance cost is also significantly less.</p>

<p>DXTory for recording. DXTory records all audio to different tracks so you can adjust volume to each track individually later when you’re editing. DXTory also has very little performance impact compared to most capturing software.</p>
<p>If you’re going to record in high quality, you’re going to need a dedicated hard drive that is large and fast. Currently I use a 2tb 7200rpm hard drive for recording 1080p at 30/60fps.<br>

<p>Dxtory is a lot better than Fraps, it can split multiple audio and the video into different files which comes in handy quite a bit, it also has a slight increase in fps. Also render in h.264, it’s fast, top quality and very good compressed.</p>
<p>AfterFX is actually not bad to edit in, my computer isn’t the best and I fly by using it. The only problem is having to RAM preview everything.</p>

<p>Please don’t get After Effects for video editing. Use it for actual effects… Rendering a 2-3 minute clip takes a good 5+ hours, and it renders in an uncompressed AVI format, which means more space being used and you then have to compress it into another format of AVI and than convert it to be able to upload it to YouTube since they don’t take AVI files.</p>

</aside>
<p>After effects worked fine for rendering, other than it creating decently big files. I really wish Camtasia would just record the whole fucking screen so i didn’t have to play bf3 in a smaller section of my screen. Camtasia was high quality and came with an editor and probably produced smaller files. Oh well.</p>

              <p>[quote=“rip4d, post:16, topic:521419”]Well yeah FRAPs doesn’t compress the video file which makes the video huge. If you want decent editing software, just for putting clips on a timeline, maybe throwing in music and some zoom+pan effects, try Camtasia Studio 7. You can find a serial on the web for it.</p>
<p>DO NOT use Camtasia 8. Its crap.[/quote]<br>
I could understand 1GB or so, but 36GB for like a 10 minute video? It’s taking like 1 hour to compress now even on my good computer <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> All the videos I’ve seen on youtube for fraps, I am using their settings but my files seem to be much larger.</p>
<p>Even after rendering the 36GB one, it’s 3.6GB which is still a shit ton to upload…</p>
