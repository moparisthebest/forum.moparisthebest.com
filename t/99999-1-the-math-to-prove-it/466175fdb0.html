Does .999 (continued) = 1? 

There are a lot of people that say yes, and also a lot of people who would say no. There is no right or w&amp;hellip;">

        <p>As a value, .99999 is NOT 1 or else it would be 1. Logically, though, it might as well be 1. That doesn’t mean that it is or ever will be.</p>
<p>The water bottle example is wrong because you’re pouring THE CONTENTS, so you should be counting the content, NOT the bottle itself. You can’t divide (whatever the smallest thing is, atom?) in half, so it’s not even remotely possible unless you have an odd/divisible by 3 amount of (atoms?). Your example could potentially be sometimes true and that’s not definitive. Also assigning the bottle’s contents as 1 is wrong because clearly 1 can’t be divided by 3, but water can be divided equally following the aforementioned circumstances. You’re talking about a logical water bottle, which isn’t as good as a real one. What if I were to say your water bottle had the (arbitrary) value of 3? You can divide that by 3, each third is 1 and if you add them back together you get 3 again. The problem isn’t that the content can’t be divided into 3, it’s that the numbers and logic that we’re applying to this situation aren’t precise enough so what you get by dividing and multiplying is LOSS OF PRECISION which doesn’t mean that another number is the exact same as another number.

<p>who says that 1 cannot be divided by 3?</p>
<p>EDIT: for the record, infinitesimals are valid in long division which ALLOWS 1 to be divided by 3 without “loss of precision”</p>

It doesn’t work that way, sorry.</p>
<p>Also your atom example is irrelevant, numbers don’t explode when we divide them in half.</p>
<p>And yes, 1 can be divided by 3. What would you call it if I had a pie and split it among 3 people? Your logic is completely wrong, each of those ‘thirds’ is 1/3 which DOES equal .333…</p>

<p>It seems that what you’re saying is ‘.999… is not 1 because it doesn’t look like 1’. Nobody is saying they <span class="bbcode-i">look</span> the same, that’s not what this topic is about. This topic is saying, mathematically, on the number line, .999… and 1 are the <span class="bbcode-b">same value</span>, <span class="bbcode-i">not that they look the same</span>. In other words, your post is irrelevant <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> And RSPS Mirrors, you do like quite dumb if you think he’s proving your point <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

        <p>This is obvious for two different categories of analysis.</p>
<p>If you analyze it discreetly, then you run into an issue. As you continue to get smaller and smaller fractions, that is, 9(1/(10^x)), and are applying this to finite and measurable properties (such as mass or atoms or something), you’ll eventually hit a known limitation in our understanding of physics and won’t be able to go any farther. This holds true if you are storing such an instance on a computer, since a computer does not have infinite memory. This being said, it goes back to the concept of precision when analyzing this discreetly. To counteract the discreet measurement, we round up to verify precision, since we already know the smaller a fraction gets, the less impact a rounding will have on the result. Another way to think of it is, the more fractional 9s the number has, the more like 1 it becomes. Okay, cool.</p>
<p>Using infinitesimals, on the other hand, is cooler. Why? No physical limitations. We can truly represent a number which goes on forever. Fortunately, our logic from the last sentence of the discreet analysis also holds true, here. As the OP said, if we pack the number into an infinite series, we can test and verify that the series does, indeed, converge. More appropriately, it converges to one since it’s a geometry series. This doesn’t need explaining.</p>
<p>And finally, a cooler way to think about this (if you ask me). Take 1/9. You get 0.1 where the 1 repeats infinitely many times. Now multiply nine by that. 0.1111111… * 9 = 0.9999999… 0.1 repeating 1 can be represented as 1/9, as I just said like thirty words ago. Multiply that by nine in rational terms and you get 9 * (1/9) = 1.</p>
<p>I think that’s enough said there. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Edit: a continuation of repeated logic from earlier posts, it seems.</p>

        <p>In mathematics, 0.999… (also denoted ,  or “all those nines”) is a recurring decimal that is, no matter what the so-called ‘scientists’ say, in no way, shape or form equal to 1. It is at best a poser, repeatedly trying, in vain, to sit at the cool kids’ lunch table with the rest of the whole numbers.<br>
Some mathematicians state that if you can fit another number between two number (I.E. an average), then they are two different numbers. If this is not possible, then the numbers are one and the same, proving that 0.999…=1. The greatest genius of our time disagrees, however. There is a hyperreal number for 0.999… When using the Beziér-Parnot construction as outlined in 1584, one gets .999…=1-1/10^H. This is also the exact number of angels that can fit on the head of a pin. Some opposing scholars have noted that if the above is true, then  must equal 42 for no average can be found between the two. Yet, a counterproof has been found! The number 0.999…8 (that is, a number starting with 0.999, ending in 8, with an infinite number of nines in between) means that vanilla 0.999… (alternately 0.999…9) is the average of 0.999…8 and 1! Or alternately,  (i.e. 0.999… is 1 minus the reciprocal of infinity).<br>
A Pragmatic Approach</p>
<p>Fraction proof<br>
0.333…	 = &lt; 1⁄3<br>
0.666…	 = &lt; 2⁄3<br>
0.999…	 = 0.333… + 0.666…<br>
0.999…	 = &lt; 1⁄3 + 2⁄3<br>
To further understand how .999… does not equal 1, let’s do some simple arithmetic. 1⁄3 is equal to .333… while 2⁄3 is equal to .666… What happens when you add the two decimals together? Without your TI-83 plus this might be hard, especially if you’re too busy playing Tetris with it. The answer is .999… Now add the fractions 1⁄3 and 2⁄3 together. The answer to that is 1. We know that CAN’T be right! Since 1 is not equal to .999…, it can be deduced that 1⁄3 doesn’t equal .333… and 2⁄3 is not equal to .666… And in fact, a moment’s thought demonstrates this: for the same reason that .999… keeps getting closer to 1 but never gets there, .333… keeps getting closer to 1⁄3 but never gets there. Now do you see what lies they are telling us? You must realize the truth! There is no mathematics!<br>
Algebraic proof<br>
c	 = 0.999…<br>
10c	 = 9.999…<br>
10c − c	 = 9.999… − 0.999…<br>
9c	 = 8.999…<br>
c	 = 0.999…<br>
Look at this algebraic proof and tell me straight up that you understand it. If you do, then you sir are a liar. Basicaly how it works is that .999… times 10 is 9.999…, but it has 1 less 9 at the end just like if you times 37.77777 by 10 you will get 377.7777, which has 1 less seven after the decimal. The next step they force you to do is to subtract .999… from 9.999… because as they say “trailing zeros do not change a number”, but the answer is 8.999…, so 9c = 8.999… and 8.999/9 = 0.999… NOT 1.<br>
Subtraction proof<br>
Another proof is to subtract 0.999… from 1, which yields 0.000…, which is total bullshit. 1-.999… should equal .0…1, this is just pure logic, which no one in academia seems to have.<br>
“Of Course, the last 1 is so small, it can be ignored”<br>
~ A so-called mathematician on reading this article<br>
Of course not! He even contradicts himself:<br>
“Precision is the key”<br>
~ The same mathematician<br>
Geometric proof<br>
Another proof is to use the so-called geometric formula that says that the sum of the series a + ar + ar2…=a/(1-r) Anyways we converted by doing the following: 0.999… is 0.9 times the geometric series with ratio r=0.1 and starting term a=0.9. Now, using the geonetric formula, we get that 0.999…=1. Now, this is bullshit because the geometric formula also predicts that 1+2+4+8+16…=-1 which is obviously wrong. Wrong I tell you. WRONG!</p>
