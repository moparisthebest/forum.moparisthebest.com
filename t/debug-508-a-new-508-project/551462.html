<p>[CENTER]<br>
Please take 2 minutes to read below before you scroll down to the pictures.</p>
<p>So after a few days of thinking, I have decided to come back and give RSPS another go. Before I left I started a 508 project called Varrador. It seemed to be quite popular (not as popular as Gilenor 508) but was getting some recognition. It eventually turned to dust and I lost motivation with it all. Hopefully this time, things will be different!.<br>
I was hoping to see more 508’s but sadly there are only a few good server projects running the 508 framework. I shall be releasing versions of ‘Debug’ to the public in stages. This means when I create a new big update, I will upload the source to Rune-Server.</p>
<p>What Is my aim? Why am I doing this?</p>
<p>Many people have forgotten about 508’s and how good they could potentially be. I am [B]not [/B]doing this for fame nor to show of my rubbish Java knowledge. I’m only here to entertain everyone and give people ideas for there servers. I do this for fun and even when I get hate on this thread, It will not knock me down.</p>
<p>I code my own way. Everyone has there own way to code. Mine may not be the most neatest or smartest code, but It gets the job done!. I want people to learn from my Mistakes and also learn from some of my neater code. Life is a learning curve, We have to do something wrong in order to learn.</p>
<p>I will not be hosting this project to the public. Once I have completed my goals, the full source and client will be released and people can leech, host - do what ever they want with it :).</p>
<p>Without further ado, Lets get Into the fun stuff.</p>
<p>Skills</p>
<p>Cooking- Cooking Is near enough done. All fish are coded and there Is a chance that you can burn fish at a low level. I do however, need to add the correct Interfaces and string locations to get cooking near enough 100%.</p>
<p>Fletching - Fletching was the first skill I worked on. All logs are able to be cut but I have not started with Stringing, Arrows/Darts and crossbow stocks. I also need to add level requirements which Is a easy job. I have added the correct Interfaces but I cant seem to find the correct strings.</p>
<p>Summoning - This Is the skill I have worked most on. One of the best updates about 508 Is the Summoning skill so It needed to be detailed and Impressive. You are able to create pouches (With the correct Interfaces) and also able to create scrolls. You are also able to Summon your pouches but for some reason, familars don’t follow at the moment.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>Trading - Trading Is added but seems to cause some problems. I have added everything but the lend option, as well as offer x. These updates will come but they don’t seem important at the moment.<br>
Shop Handler - Shopping base has been added but there really Isn’t any need to create any shops at the moment.<br>
Banking- Bank tabs, Noting works. Deposit x is a little glitchy at the moment so I have removed it for the moment.<br>
High Definition + Full Screen - All working nicely.<br>
Level up- Leveling up interfaces have been updated with the correct text and skill icons. Also flashing skill when you level up has been added and greets you with the interface on what you have unlocked ect.<br>
Cleaning up - I have cleaned up a lot of code in process. This has hopefully improved stability.<br>
Items lost on death- Items Lost on death has been added as well as the Interface that shows what you are keeping and loosing.<br>
Weapon Anims - All weapon special attacks and bonuses are added.</p>
<p>If you have read this far, Congratulations! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Below Is the content I want to add next. I am not setting a time date, taking it as it comes :).<br>
Future Content</p>
<p>Runecrafting - Runecrafting has got to be my favoruite skill. I want Runecrafting to be near enough perfect but will take me some time.<br>
Fishing- Should be quite easy to add.<br>
Cooking- I want to finish off cooking by adding the Interfaces.<br>
Woodcutting- Tree decaying and stuff like that Is annoying but It needs to be done</p>
<p>Duel Arena - I’m not sure If I am going to add this yet or not. Seems like a waste of space.<br>
Character Customization - I have a small base I started work on but need to add saving.<br>
Player vs Monster - I need to add a strong base. Of course I cant make it 100% as it is virtually Impossible but I want it close. (I’m a bit of a perfectionist)</p>
<p>These will be updated slowly but surely.</p>
<p>Well, here Is some media so far. Remember to post your thoughts and I am always open for constructive criticism.</p>
<p>[spoiler]<br>
Updates as off - 21/05/2015:</p>
<p>The updates you are about to read about are the best updates so far. I have gone through a lot of stress getting these bits of content to work and they are far off from completion.</p>
<p>[ul][B]Construction[/B]</p>
<p>Construction has been a very difficult skill to work with and has gotten very annoying. I have finally managed to create POH (Player owned houses) that save and you can actually build new objects.<br>
I have configured witch Interfaces belong to each object, but I still need to add room creation. I have started work on gardens as this Is a fairly simple process as It is only creating a few global objects (Which the server can deal with) Its when I go to the more bigger rooms the server seems to struggle. I will eventually find a fix, but for now I am burnt out with construction.<br>
[B]<br>
Of course, as Construction Is still getting developed there are a few bugs. The bugs/glitches are as follows.[/B]</p>
<p>[<em>] Players can not leave their house via the ‘Leave house’ Button.<br>
[</em>] When players enter building mode, the button doesn’t turn red.<br>
[<em>] Players cant create rooms at the moment.<br>
[</em>] Some Interfaces have black borders around them.</p>
<p>[B]Woodcutting[/B]<br>
Alongside Construction, I have been creating a stable Woodcutting handler which I am now pleased to say Is ‘Flawless’. Of course, I still need to do the configuration, e.g, adding the correct tree stump ID’s and exp rates ect ect… Tree stumps are spawned as a GlobalObject when the tree is destroyed. The stumps take over the tree location and the tree spawns back quicker or slower depending what tree It is (I can set a custom delay If I want to). Normal trees are only able to produce the player 1 log (Just like Runescape) and the higher trees produce more logs which run on random calculations.<br>
[B]I am yet to create Bird’s Nest droppings but It is next on my to do list.[/B][/ul]</p>
<p>[B]Here are the recent pictures. Remember to share this project around and lets get It some love!.[/B]</p>

<p>[SPOILER=09/05/2015 Updates:][CENTER]So the past day, I have made a lot of progress!.</p>
<p>I have started on a Magic base which works on NPC’s but I need to make MagicOnPlayer. The Magic On NPC Is still a little buggy but will get sorted soon.<br>
MagicOnItem is very buggy and I am going to re-write this as soon as possible.<br>
Range on NPC/Player is working. RangeOnNPC don’t seem to like crossbows so I need to re code that. Some of your arrows also drop on the floor.<br>
I worked on Dh effects. Low hp now makes you hit higher.<br>
I have added all the correct animations to most weapons.<br>
Skilling Interface level up now shows the correct skill when leveling up as well as the interface that shows what you can now make.<br>
I added a really shit woodcutting handler. I will eventually re write this as It is so horrid.<br>
I have also changed the spawn location to those who may want to know. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>What I have removed</p>
<p>I have removed my Summoning handler as It was causing some weird bug when players create pouches. I will re write this probably tomorrow and make it much better.<br>
I removed cooking for now as the handler I created was really shit.</p>
<p>What Next:</p>
<p>I need to add NPC agression and also give all NPC’s there correct HP, Strength, Defense, Attack properties and also correct combat animations.<br>
NPC Dialogue base.<br>
RuneCrafting<br>
Re-create Summoning<br>
Re-create Cooking</p>

        <p>Thank’s for all the messages. Sorry I havent updated. I have been away working and working on the project along side. Anyway here is the recent project updates! Enjoy!</p>
<p>[SIZE=5][B]DEBUG - 508 REVISION[/B][/SIZE]</p>
<p>[COLOR="<span class="hashtag">#F0FFFF</span>"]It’s me! Tricky from Rune-Server, I will make sure I post about this new thread on my Tricky account so more people can know about the new Debug project.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have decided to start fresh with my 508 server. Start again, and this time do a lot of things differently and more efficient. There isn’t a specific reason why I wanted to start fresh, I just thought It was needed.<br>
I have started from a clean base and I am going to add even better content than I did last time.</p>
<p>Debug Is a 508 RuneScape Private Server running Dark Regen’s Palidino76 frame work. (A reworked version of Palidino76’s source). My aim is to create a fully playable source for people to download and enjoy If they wish. I am attempting to recreate RuneScape but with custom features a private server should have. I shall not be hosting this project, It’s only for educational purposes. Yes, some people have problems with Palidino76’s source but It isn’t their problem that I am using It to create my project.[/COLOR]</p>
<p>I will improve the layout of this post when I am back from work. but for now enjoy.</p>

        <p>Updates as off - 21/05/2015:</p>
<p>The updates you are about to read about are the best updates so far. I have gone through a lot of stress getting these bits of content to work and they are far off from completion.</p>
<p>[ul][B]Construction[/B]<br>
Construction has been a very difficult skill to work with and has gotten very annoying. I have finally managed to create POH (Player owned houses) that save and you can actually build new objects.<br>
I have configured witch Interfaces belong to each object, but I still need to add room creation. I have started work on gardens as this Is a fairly simple process as It is only creating a few global objects (Which the server can deal with) Its when I go to the more bigger rooms the server seems to struggle. I will eventually find a fix, but for now I am burnt out with construction.<br>
[B]<br>
Of course, as Construction Is still getting developed there are a few bugs. The bugs/glitches are as follows.[/B]</p>
<p>[<em>] Players can not leave their house via the ‘Leave house’ Button.<br>
[</em>] When players enter building mode, the button doesn’t turn red.<br>
[<em>] Players cant create rooms at the moment.<br>
[</em>] Some Interfaces have black borders around them.</p>
<p>[B]Woodcutting[/B]<br>
Alongside Construction, I have been creating a stable Woodcutting handler which I am now pleased to say Is ‘Flawless’. Of course, I still need to do the configuration, e.g, adding the correct tree stump ID’s and exp rates ect ect… Tree stumps are spawned as a GlobalObject when the tree is destroyed. The stumps take over the tree location and the tree spawns back quicker or slower depending what tree It is (I can set a custom delay If I want to). Normal trees are only able to produce the player 1 log (Just like Runescape) and the higher trees produce more logs which run on random calculations.<br>
[B]I am yet to create Bird’s Nest droppings but It is next on my to do list.[/B]</p>
<p>[B]Here are the recent pictures. Remember to share this project around and lets get It some love!.[/B]</p>
