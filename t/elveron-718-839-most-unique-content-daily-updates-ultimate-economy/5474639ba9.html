        <p>I made a major desicion today that I have been thinking about for a few days. Players have been pushing this idea for quite a while, however I have been on the edge of this for a bit. However after tons of players convincing me, I have come to the desicion. Drygores are currently the most powerful weapons ingame, more powerful than Chaotics, Godswords, etc. But how come Drygores are way easier to get than those items? I noticed that 75% of the players owned Drygores, which is actually a major problem. The most OP weapons should be special and not as easy to get. Therefore, I have decided to add the Kalphite King which will drop them. It should be finished with an epic combat script and minions by the end of this week. Now, what did I do since there is a gigantic surplus of drygores? All of the drygores have been converted into prestige tokens, 10 of them which can be found in your bank. Now, these prestige tokens will be to use. I added new rewards to the Prestige Shop such as Trickster, Doomcare, Sleds, etc. however, I am not done. I will be taking even more suggestions for new rewards for the Prestige Shop. Hey, they don’t even need to be item suggestions. They can be abilities, bonuses, etc.</p>
<p>On a second note, Strikecarl will now be helping us find bugs. Carl is a very talented bug finder from RSPUnit that has been able to find the most abuseable and game breaking bugs we have experienced. Working alongside with us, we will patch as many bugs as we can and make Elveron a better server. Hopefully this partnership will carry on for a long time, and I hope to see an even brighter future for Elveron.</p>
<p>So, I know some of you are upset, however this does have an upside that may not be so exciting right at this moment, but in the future it will look brighter:<br>
-New weapons will be in place of the Drygores in the Prestige Shop including brand new items such as the Brutal Whip, Crystal Bow, the Blazing Lash, and more :o<br>
-There will be an ultimate new boss the Kalphite King that will drop valuable items including the beloved Drygores.<br>
-Tomorrow, I will be increasing the drop rates of the PvM weapons that have been too hard to get (Hilts, SS, Vine Whips, etc.).<br>
-Those items that people would normally PvM with on servers that have been near impossible to get on Elveron will now be possible since they are needed.</p>
<p>We may suffer from a slight fall back, I am aware. But we will recover in time. I will never, ever give up on Elveron. It is better that we have done this now rather than at 200+ players. We all know it had to have been done eventually, and 50+ drygores ingame is a nono. I am only doing what is best in the long run.</p>
<p>PLEASE suggest new rewards for prestige shop, PLEASE PLEASE!</p>
<p>11/18/14<br>
-Major work done on the Duel Arena.<br>
-Worked a bit on some combat formulas for magic.<br>
-Fixed some issues regarding potions and flasks.<br>
-Added onto a few of the skill stores.<br>
-Removed Drygores from the Prestige Shop.<br>
-Converted all of the Drygores ingame to Prestige Tokens sent to the player’s bank.<br>
-Added the model for the Kalphite King, will come out this week.<br>
-The Kalphite King will drop Drygores.<br>
-Added the proper coin amount to Max’s resetting task.<br>
-Added new rewards to the Prestige Shop including Trickster, Sleds, Weapons, and more!</p>

        <p>As I promised, I worked hard and long on these new Prestige rewards and drop rate improvements to begin getting “non drygore weapons/good armor” ingame and not so impossible. Many fixes to come tomorrow.</p>
<p>11/19/14<br>
-Added new items to the Prestige Store: Tzhaar Rapier, Warped Claws, Death Cape, Blazing Flameberg, and Brutal Whip.<br>
-The Brutal Whip has stats that are slightly higher than its ancestor, the Vine Whip.<br>
-This awesome whip also has a specail that resembles the whip’s tangle effect while hitting 3 times, resembling nearly a Dragon Dagger.<br>
-The Warped Claws have the stats of the good old Dragon Claws.<br>
-What makes the Warped Claws so special are that they are the original Dragon Claws, not the EoC one handed ones, but the original pair.<br>
-These claws have the special of the original Dragon Claws and pack the same punch.<br>
-The Tzhaar Rapier has no special, however it is a very fast and powerful rapier.<br>
-This rapier is not as powerful as the Chaotic Rapier, however it is the second most powerful rapier ingame.<br>
-The Blazing Flameberg is one of the most awesome looking and worthy two handed swords.<br>
-This has a special attack that is similar to one of the Godswords.<br>
-The Blazing Flameberg has stats that resemble all four of the godswords, since it is the ultimate godsword.<br>
-The Death Cape is a powerful cape that has stats similar, but slightly better, than those of a Max Cape.<br>
-Why does this cape have better stats than a max cape? Prestiging is already achieving max, so we can go farther right?<br>
-This cape also has the ability to give a 1 in 5,000 chance of instantly killing the MONSTER (not players) that you are fighting like a Death Touched Dart.<br>
-Added the Dragon Chainbody drop to the Kalphite Queen and increased the Dragon 2h Sword rate.<br>
-Increased the rates of Hilts, Subjugation, Saradomin Amulets (Whisper, etc.), Bandos Gear, and Saradomin Sword.<br>
-Increased the rates of Draconic Visage and Dragonbone Upgrade Kits (King Black Dragon).<br>
-Added the Seercull Bow drop to the Dagannoth Kings and increased the rates of the Rings.</p>

        <p>This has been the day. Not too many updates due to the stress of fixing the hardware failure and also the many accounts that were bugged. Seemed to get most of them done that were brought to my attention. Tomorrow is Friday, so more to come then. In the meantime, let’s just kick back, relax, and recover from that down time.</p>

<p>Horrific weekend, really. Those exploits used to crash and break the server were aweful. But, we are finally over it. Elveron is here, and we certainly DO NOT give up. No matter how bad things get, we have a large team that is willing to put in the extra effort to make sure everything is running as its supposed to. After the hard work put in by the development team and the awesome help of developers on Rune-Server, we have quashed this major issue. I am very happy that we have been averaging 80 online still this weekend after the hours and hours of downtime and the many crashes. It shows that we have both loyal and amazing players. Anyways, with the website down AS WELL, I wasn’t able to post the updates. However, here are the weekend’s updates. I focused this weekend on bug fixes and performance improvements. I will be doing this for a while before we have new content so that Elveron can be the most enjoyable experience for you guys.</p>
<p>By the way, we are on a new web host. For all the details, view this thread: <a href="http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/1385-new-host-voting-online/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/1385-new-host-voting-online/</a></p>
<p>Lastly, let’s congratulate <a class="mention" href="../../u/apollo.html">@Apollo</a> on his new Co-Owner position, <a class="mention" href="../../u/rockon.html">@Rockon</a> on his new Moderator position, and <a class="mention" href="../../u/forever.html">@Forever</a> on his new Support position. Also, <a class="mention" href="../../u/chloe.html">@Chloe</a> is now our Technical Support who is going to be able to fix bugs on the spot when needed, solve hardware issues, improve server performance, fix accounts that are bugged, and all those things.</p>

        <p>So, didn’t get much done today. I had an interview for MIT and it went great. Was able to show the interviewer software that I developed (non-rsps) recently for fun, it was very casual, and things went smoothly and it was actually enjoyable. I also got my flu shot while I was out. So, since you guys went crazy over the weekend’s fixes, here I am with more! Enjoy you guys!</p>
<p>On another note, since it is vacation on Wedneday, there will be a lot flowing in and many events ingame. I hope to see our playercount recover from the weekend.</p>
<p>There will also be something special I will be doing on Thanks Giving day :3</p>

        <p>I had virtually no time to be on the computer today, sorry. I have so much going on IRL that it is crazy and I just couldn’t deal with all the stress. I also had a 3 hour swim practice today, and after burning thousands of calories in a single evening, I am completely out of energy and need to get some rest very early. In my fatigue, I was able to get a few updates done, but not many. I love Elveron so I won’t let you guys down. Here we go:</p>
<p>11/25/14<br>
-Adjusted some of the drop rates.<br>
-Gave the ability for banned users to appeal on the forums.<br>

-IP Banned users will not have the appeal section opened for obvious reasons.<br>
-Started to re work the punishment system.<br>
-New rules on punishments and how appeals are dealt with is in progress and an official list will be posted this week.</p>

        <p>The rate at which Elveron is growing is astounding, I’ve never seen a server take of this much.<br>
It has to be from the friendly community and constant, daily updates.</p>

<p>In the spirit of Thanksgiving, I have put out a new event for Elveron. This is not a large event like Halloween or Christmas since it is not celebrated world wide, however I felt the need to still have an event. The event is explained in more detail in the update log. I am also getting closer to a solution for the NPC nulling, however time will tell. Good night everyone and I will see you guys tomorrow (when I’m not cooking)!</p>
<p>11/26/14<br>
-Fixed null pointers caused by certain Ganodermic creatures.<br>
-Re did the combat scripts of the Polypore Dungeon monsters that were extremely glitchy.<br>
-Fixed some crash issues in the Polypore Dungeon.<br>
-Made some major work on the NPC nulling, time will tell if this made a difference.<br>
-To celebrate Thanksgiving, we will be having a Thanksgiving event that will carry out till Sunday night!<br>
-All of the Penguin H&amp;S penguins are now turkeys.<br>
-Added every single turkey variation of the current penguins after finding all those id’s o.o<br>
-Added some twists to a few of the hints that needed fixing.<br>
-Added Thanksgiving related rewards to finding these turkeys.<br>
-You still receive penguin points for finding the turkeys.<br>
-Looting these turkeys will also gaurentee a turkey and drumsticks to eat, cause food is one of the best parts of Thanksgiving right?<br>
-The Thanksgiving food can be eaten and heals quite a favorable amount.<br>
-Special Thanksgiving rewards listed below are given at chance and are not received every time!<br>
-Added a reward of Mackers the turkey, and what player wouldn’t want to walk around with the most swagged out turkey?<br>
-Added a fillable Cornucopia to store food in and heal at ease.<br>
-Added an awesome looking Turkey Hat as a possible reward.</p>

<p>Hello Elveron players and happy Thanks Giving! I hope everyone had an enjoyable day today, as did I on my first complete break in ages. Had some good times with family, stuffed myself three times today, got to try out Far Cry 4 (which I purchased Monday but held off till today just for Elveron &lt;3), it was just a great day over all. And of course, swimming starts again the next day so I will be back on that schedule, but I have to burn off all that pie and stuffing anyways (dat swimmer burn of 20k+ calories per week). Anyways, I will be online with you guys tomorrow and on TeamSpeak for a long time.</p>
<p>Now, for the moment you guys have been waiting for. Technically this is an update for today, because I finished it at 1am last night, and that is today. So, I STILL HAVE YET TO MISS A DAY OF UPDATES! Through sickness, through school, through sports, through holidays, through commitments, I have been here for you guys, and each one of you deserves more <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> So, our NPC nulling issue is gone.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: Since I rewrote the NPC spawning system, I have not finished converting all the NPC spawns to their correct positions. This means that some NPC’s such as King Black Dragon, Vorago, etc. may be missing, but they are not nulled. They will be converted when I wake up in the morning. There is only a select few of them that are missing so don’t worry.</p>
<p>Also, a dedication to Elveron: <a href="http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/1514-who-are-you-thankful-for/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://elveron.org/community/index.php?/topic/1514-who-are-you-thankful-for/</a></p>
<p>11/27/14<br>
-COMPLETELY FIXED NPC NULLING!<br>
-Rewrote the NPC Spawning system.<br>
-Added a system to check the regions for dissappearing/nulled NPCs.<br>
-The system then refers to the database of initially spawned NPCs and fixes the broken ones.<br>
-More efficient method of respawning NPCs.</p>
