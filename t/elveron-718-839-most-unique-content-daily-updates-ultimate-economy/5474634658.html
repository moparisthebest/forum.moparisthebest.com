<p>Next, we have very exciting news. Since we had enough in donations, we have two things coming in tomorrow. First off, we have officially purchased a Runelocus Banner and it should be coming in tomorrow morning! Secondly, we purchased a dedicated server which I will expand on below.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time setting up our new dedicated server, 32GB RAM (regular), AMD Opteron, 3.1GHz on Windows. Then it dawned on me, I could have gotten a better dedicated server for the same price if I ran it on Linux. And then I realized, hey, I can still code on linux, use eclipse, access dropbox, skype, everything I need on Linux, so why not just get the better dedicated server and run on Linux. After all, Linux is 10000% more secure than Windows, and it has killer network speeds and gets more kick out of the specs. So, here are the details of our incoming new dedicated server:</p>
<p>64GB RAM DDR3 ECC 1600MHz<br>
3.7GHz+/3.9GHz+ Frequency/Burst<br>
2x2 TB SATA3 Hard Disk<br>
Intel Xeon E5-1620v2<br>
Excellent DDoS Protection (better than our current one which still has held off our attackers)<br>
4 Cores, 8 Threads</p>
<p>This Dedicated Server kicks ass, and will be $137/month which is something we can afford with the generous donations of our players. The player base is growing and we need better equipment to support an almost constant 50+ and high peaks, since we are aiming to see 100 online soon we have to move from a VPS to a Dedicated Server for top quality performance.</p>
<p>As I said, I am not in this for the money. Coding is a passion of mine and I have fun with it. I use the donations to what is needed and often ask players what we should spend the donations on. We have been working on advertisements, gold on toplists, new equipment, etc. Now that we have a Runelocus banner and a few on other various sites, hopefully we can start bringing in more donations to buy more banners on other websites. Hitting the big ones as soon as we can.</p>
<p>I will update everyone on the Dedicated Server status tomorrow.</p>

        <p>I am not going to post any updates today, because it is progress. This is more like a behind the scenes post, for future updates to come and a news flash on today, however I will make an official Behind The Scenes post later on.</p>
<p>First, an update on the dedicated server. Paypal is being frustrating and has said the payment would be processed between 24-48 hours incase the payment was not authorized by me (even if I called them saying I authorized it) since I made lots of payments recently. So, as of now it has been around 30 hours so we will see tomorrow if they finally accept the request. So, hopefully we can get the dedicated server up and running by tomorrow.</p>
<p>Now secondly, we just received our Runelocus ad this morning. Hopefully it can start to grow our player base more thanks to your donations, and our new dedicated server arriving tomorrow (hopefully) will be able to support the new player count.</p>
<p>Lastly, King Fox is working on a great new feature for our website. A Clan Portal. This clan portal will allow players to log in to the portal with their ingame usernames and passwords. It will be able to tell what clan you are in and your rank. You will be able to link ingame with your clan on the Portal and it will display the top clans for categories such as skilling/pvm/pking/overall/etc. There will also be pages for each of the clans, clan searching, clan sizes, etc. You will be able to apply to these clans using forms that the clan owners can define for them. Clan members will be able to manage the applications and recruit players in the portal. It will be an awesome new way to get the clans interacting and competitive. Keep an eye out!</p>

        <p>News on the Dedicated Server! After many quarrels with Paypal, they couldn’t approve the payments and simply refunded me, waste of a 1-2 day wait. Anyways, I made another payment and the Dedicated Server arrived today. Unfortunately because of the hassle Paypal gave me, it arrived to late for me to finish setting up. Anyways, I did get some things accomplished on the Dedicated Server today with my time. I set up remote desktop connections so I can access it from my phone, chromebook, wherever. Also set up a desktop on it so that I can code on the environment when necessary. Got JDK and JRE installed, just need to set the environment variables. The rest will be setup tomorrow. Reason being tomorrow is that Dropbox on the Dedicated Server is still downloading the server files and setting up. This will take a while and will be done way after I am asleep. So, we will have moved by tomorrow, but most things are set up anyways.</p>
<p>Secondly, I will be going on another college tour (AGAIN, had to change plans to this weekend on short notice due to SAT’s), however I will only be gone Friday afternoon till Sunday morning, so I will have lovely Sunday with you guys. I will provide more information tomorrow.</p>
<p>Third, the new Clans Page is looking good and King Fox has made lovely progress that I will post this weekend.</p>
<p>Fourth, I made some fixes to some minor things in the extra time I had while waiting for Paypal to cooperate.</p>
<p>Last, DOUBLE VOTE REWARDS ARE ON TILL MONDAY! So what does that mean? Vote vote vote!</p>

        <p>Good news bad news. Well, let’s start off with the bad news so things get better in this post. I caught something on my college tour and now I’m incredibly sick. Ever since I got back yesterday at 4am, I’ve been stuck on my coach because I have had absoltutely no energy and my body doesn’t feel like doing anything. I stayed away from the computer cause it was sure to give me migranes. Then I slept from 2pm - 9am this morning. I am feeling a bit better, but I won’t be on today most likely as I still need to rest.</p>
<p>(by the way, this is last night’s update, fell asleep early)</p>
<p>We are now on the dedicated server! And I was happy to hear from many of the players who usually suffer from lag that they have experienced no more delays, that everything runs more smoothly, etc. That is good news to hear and I am starting to love working on Linux. Looks like this was a good buy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the 5-6 accounts that are bugged, you will need an admin to assist you. I wanted to assist yesterday but I just felt aweful. Although, Apollo/Innocent/Light can help you, and I also gave Raipperi permissions to help you with this situation. So if you need help, please contact any of them. Thanks!</p>
<p>Enjoy Elveron you guys and let’s hit the big numbers!</p>

<p>Bleh, spent another day in bed… Nothing much to say, things have been boring for me with all this sleep. Hopefully I will get better. Most of these updates I coded a few days ago and released today, I tend to save stuff to release on days like this. Here are the updates (I will pick winners, I just feel aweful).</p>
<p>11/13/14<br>
-Removed the random teleporting while thieving since that is easily bypassable.<br>
-Instead, implemented our new Random Event system.<br>
-Added rewards to the random event box, however they will be improved this weekend.<br>
-Random events that have been added include: Evil Bob’s Island, Rune Pin Ball, and the Sandwhich Lady.<br>
-Added a system to handle creating the instanced areas for the random events.<br>
-Fixed some issues with certain items.<br>
-Adjusted prices for a few flasks.<br>
-Fixed up some things and touched up the GUI.<br>
-Cleaned up commands, removed unnecessary commands.<br>
-Summoning not adding up to created pouches on completionist cape has been fixed.<br>
-Fixed a nullpointer found within tile walking.<br>
-Inited ::1hp command again! For dharokers wanting to be 1hp (no people under 980 hp can use it), skiller friendly, if you’re a skiller it’ll knock you to 1hp too!</p>
