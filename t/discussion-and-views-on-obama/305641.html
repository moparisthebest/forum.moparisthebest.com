<p>[hr]</p>
<p>Comment in general:<br>
Obama’s Advisor Valerie Jarrett was recently accused of pocketing government subsidies for housing (<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/news/2008/nov/obama-advisor-valerie-jarrett-linked-real-estate-scandals">http://www.judicialwatch.org/news/2008/nov/obama-advisor-valerie-jarrett-linked-real-estate-scandals</a>). Chances are she will be forced to resign seeing as how Glenn has forced about 3 or 4(Van Jones and Yosi Sergant are all i can think of atm)  people already to be forced to resign by Barack Obama himself(If GB was wrong, they wouldn’t have been fired now would they?), and Valerie is next. They were all forced to resigned by scandals they’ve committed. My main question is why would Obama hire these types of people, and why would they do such a thing? He knows how badly he’s being watched and its not doing him any good with people like this in office =\</p>
<p>Also for those of you who live in the US, Obama recently made a speech about having year around school… Which im iffy about because it would mean we have more breaks but it would also be alot more annoying. What do you think about that? IYO</p>
<p>I also find it funny that we… lit up? the empire state building to celebrate China’s 60 years of communism…? Odd <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Also, im not drawing all the attention onto me even though it may seem like it. Im just continuing the other thread, view it as if someone else posted it.</span></p>

Because other countries don’t know exactly what hes doing.[/quote]</p>
<p>What the fuck are you talking about? The only person ill-informed here, is you. Stop with the bullshit. Since his inauguration, has he really done anything to disrupt the daily lives of Americans? There haven’t been any cataclysmic Earth shattering events since he became President.</p>
<p>In fact his lack of action is the main reason why Americans are becoming irritated. The retarded masses of America think that because they didn’t get a check for $100,000 from the Gov’t, that something is fucked up. He doesn’t kill babies and drink their brains, he’s not the next Stalin either. If anything he’s trying to help improve the living condition of Americans.</p>
<p>You’re initial post sounds like a garbled up news broadcast from Hannity’s television show. All that shit is Propaganda. Most, if not all, of their so called ‘information’ is rarely backed up by fact. And when there is any ‘fact’ it’s usually misconstrued to make Obama look like the Antichrist.</p>
<p>You might think from my viewpoint that I’m a liberal, and I want to take your guns. And that’s not the truth at all. I live in Kentucky, own many guns, and am an educated person who doesn’t listen to my mommy and daddy talk about politics. My father is very right winged, so is my mother. But all they watch is fox news, they call all the other news stations biased. Which is comical because it’s just the opposite.</p>

        <p>Im not basing him messing up because i didn’t get a check, lol. Its what he’s trying to do. The long term effects of what hes trying to do is going to ruin the U.S. Where are you getting all of this stuff lol? You’ve racked up a couple of his stereotypes and some that i’ve never heard of <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I’ve never said he was an anti-christ nor do i believe this. You’re in the same boat that alot of people i know are, that he hasn’t been in office long enough or he hasn’t done anything to screw peoples lives up. Of course he wants to improve the lives of Americans, what president doesn’t want to? Its how hes going about doing this that is the problem. If the information being broadcasted was false, it would be shut down. I used an example earlier. If someone created a news broadcast about how he was the antichrist and we were all doomed, they would be shut down. Not to mention Washington is constantly bombarded with questions from these people yet they never respond, maybe to a couple but its never an answer.</p>
<p>I actually looked back at my original post and laughed it does sound like something in the newspaper :P. I jumped out of no where and did say alot of stuff. Mainly this was more focused on how Advisors and Czars are being forced to resigned because of what they’ve done. And if they were not supposed to be forced to resigned Obama would not have told them to resign. Edited etc 4 retardness on my part.</p>

<p>Because other countries don’t know exactly what hes doing.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>What the fuck are you talking about? The only person ill-informed here, is you. Stop with the bullshit. Since his inauguration, has he really done anything to disrupt the daily lives of Americans? There haven’t been any cataclysmic Earth shattering events since he became President.</p>
<p>In fact his lack of action is the main reason why Americans are becoming irritated. The retarded masses of America think that because they didn’t get a check for $100,000 from the Gov’t, that something is fucked up. He doesn’t kill babies and drink their brains, he’s not the next Stalin either. If anything he’s trying to help improve the living condition of Americans.</p>
<p>You’re initial post sounds like a garbled up news broadcast from Hannity’s television show. All that shit is Propaganda. Most, if not all, of their so called ‘information’ is rarely backed up by fact. And when there is any ‘fact’ it’s usually misconstrued to make Obama look like the Antichrist.</p>
<p>You might think from my viewpoint that I’m a liberal, and I want to take your guns. And that’s not the truth at all. I live in Kentucky, own many guns, and am an educated person who doesn’t listen to my mommy and daddy talk about politics. My father is very right winged, so is my mother. But all they watch is fox news, they call all the other news stations biased. Which is comical because it’s just the opposite.[/quote]He’s drove the Nation into BILLIONS of dollars more into debt since his election (although Bush is part of the reason, BUT NOT ALL, like most people keep concluding).</p>

My dads plan B is Australia, and i actually wouldn’t mind <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Its a nice place. Better than the dump country i live in.</p>
<p>Also for those of you who live in the US, Obama recently made a speech about having year around school… Which im iffy about because it would mean we have more breaks but it would also be alot more annoying.</p>
