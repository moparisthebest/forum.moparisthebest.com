    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-soul-vx-re-write-in-progress/90034</link>
    <description>Welcome, My name is [s]Zamathiar[/s] soon to be Soul VX. I am starting a project (and willproably do by-myself).

[size=25pt] PROJECT SOUL VX[/size]

This is going to be an out-of-your-world Server/client........

But before I start I will be learning the common and probably all the java codings......And i shal become a master coder lol..I will also brush up on my HTML a little more.

Since i will be doing this PROJECT alone then these things are essential. Not to worry it will be ready in about 5 mounths or fewer. I know this sounds noobish too, but i would like some help from other coders.....Gatering info on java/html tutorials and sending me links...also pictures for my client that match the title Soul VX.

If you would like to do this for me plz copy and paste and fill this out for me:

Name:
Experiance:(coder or whatever):
What will you find for me:(pics or tuts):
Other Info:

If accepted you will be credited as a part of my Project team members and will recieve credits for help when i post my finished GAME.

Hopefully, no one will mock me, spamm this thread or whatever for having this dream of a server/client/web-site.

Yes, this Server/client will be on a web-site laied out like runescape only wayyyyyyyy different and i will use HTML and not some cheesy site like freewebs!!!!!


Ty and post feedback plz:

Zamathiar soon to be Soul VX

Btw:

Plz post feedback on what i should add to my server/client/website to give me ideas you can also fill out that form above and say your going to help me with ideas. YOU WILL ALSO BE GIVEN CREDIT.
And lastly, plz post feedback on what i should add to this post



Ty again, 

Zamathiar soon to be Soul VX
