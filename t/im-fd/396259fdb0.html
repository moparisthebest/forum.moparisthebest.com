<p>You didn’t listen to a single word I said did you? You will only have yourself to blame. My brother did the same thing. He dated a psycho chick, they broke up. She went out with this psycho dude and eventually he went to jail or something. She wanted him back. They had a kid, so he married her. She hit the kid and cheated on him, so they got divorced. I fear something along the same line will happen to you. You seem like a nice guy, like my brother, and I fear for the worst.</p>

Are you fucking stupid? [sarcasm] I usually go back to the girl that has broken up with me <span class="bbcode-b"> 4 </span> times. [/sarcasm] OVER THE SAME REASON.<br>
Maybe she’s not for you, I dont know. Just generally when someone breaks up with me four times, and especially for the same reason, I take that as a hint it’s not going to work out.</p>

        <p>Well right now im single. my ex wants to date girls, im want to tell her to forget it b/c the girls shes dating all live in the same area and live a distance away from her, closer than me but still. all shes had is drama with them. as far as i know shes single, and she was worried her ex gf is going to kill herself b/c she said she was and she hadnt txted her back in an hour. i went to sleep and didnt worry about it b/c i figured when we all woke up everything would be ok and everyone would still be alive. she said she was thinking about dying, and i told her if she did anything to herself it would hurt me and probably kill me.</p>
<p>so ive been talking to other girls <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> woot. one is a model and vocalist in her own band, shes turning 21 this year, ive actually hung out with her in person(so far the only thing we’ve done is smoking a hookah at a hookah bar), shes like a 15 min drive from me, shes nice and mature, she told me she has a crush on me, and im starting to get one for her.</p>
<p>the other girl is a friend of my ex, they arent too good of friends according to my ex, but this girl is pretty turning 18 this year, and ive only talked to her on fb, and txt. the 17 year old and i seem to be talking a lot more than the 20 year old, but she lives the farthest away from me, even farther than my ex. but still im still in love with my ex.</p>
<p>i think the 17 year old has feeling for me(she txted me all day yesterday, and shes started txting me, and usually i have to txt who ever to start talking to them, also she keeps bringing up that she thinks i like her alot) but she keeps saying no she doesnt, i find the 17 year old very interesting, last night when she said she was going to bed she told me she loved me bestie. which confused me i didnt know i was her bestie.</p>
<p>well ill bbl.</p>
<p>edit: god i hate every site that is too lazy to implement a more secure method of having photos on the web. oh no its too hard and complicated to do anything but make things bypass-able b/c u want to keep a naming convention… there are smarter ways to keep a collection of photos to one account, and to me the way facebook implemented that is a flaw in design. js. well I should of known u could track someone through facebook pics… w/e should have just uploaded to dropbox. rant done.</p>
<p>i would show the other girl but ya i feel like i hurt her too bad so ill just let her be. i could put a pic of me up but that doesnt really matter.</p>
<p>also if u feel like suggesting anything u can, but i decided i guess im just going to live and learn. so idk if this thread should die or not, idk if i should keep it up to date.</p>
<p>if u think the thread should die then just post that as ur comment.</p>
