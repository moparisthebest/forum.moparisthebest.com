About Us[/b]

[b]Bancraft is mature server for hardcore Minecraft players who believe that one is entitled to the sweat of his brow.

There is no parenting of chat and no gifting of materials. It is not for carebears, nor the feint of heart.

The map is still in its infancy and a several fallen faction bases lay unclaimed for the discovering and much of the land is ripe with resources for the taking.

Join alone or with friends, create a faction, claim land, forge alliances and wage wars upon your enemies. Defend your bases whilst laying waste to others.

Bancraft is seeking the best of the best; bandits, crafters, builders, and miners.

No application. No donations.
