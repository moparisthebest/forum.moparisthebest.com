    <description>[center][b]Project 1337-Pwnage
As you would all know, runescape pking is dead. Many runescape pkers have resorted to Moparscape, but are yet to find a pking simulator server. This is our goal.

Introduction

The 1337-Pwnage project isn&#39;t just another zdiddyscape or Battlescape Blitz. This server will be perfect. It will be the best server in Mopar!

Goals
This server will not be easy to code. It will require determination and skill.
We have the goals and they will be completed.

Working special attacks - Like runescape
Weapon Timers - Like runescape
Food Timers - Like runescape
Full defence system - Having defence counts for somthing
Full Lunar Magics - On the 1337-Pwnage Client (proper sprites)
Full Ancient Magiks.
Full Modern Magics
Single combat areas.
Multi combat areas.
Stable source code (no bugs/glitches)
Full Range (Correct GFX and double hitting dbow, hits based off your bonus)
Full prayer. (new prayers if possible)
Training isn&#39;t hard about 80xp per hit (NPC training)
Hp Goes up overtime.
Full PVP combat
Wilderness skulls.
Working player kill Drops
If your level 70 and your in level one wilderness you can attack level 69-71
No commands - Admin and mod exempt.
Pking in wilderness only.
Correct bonuses
A nice econamy (easier than runescapes)
Full potions.
Nice shops.

What the 1337-Pwnage client will have.

Full Lunar Magic 
Full items like fighter torso and darkbow
Clan chat
All Magics on the magic tab (None on the bar next to friends)
A interface like runescape&#39;s.
Working prayer icons.
