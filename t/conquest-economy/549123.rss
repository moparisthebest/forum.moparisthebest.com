    <description>Hello everyone,

[/spoiler]
[SPOILER=1/10/15]
This thread will be updated continuously throughout the day and will consist of small updates/patches.

Enchanted Crystal Keys are now added in-game, these can be obtained only by the high-tier Champions at the moment but should be adding in sometime soon to other drops.
[img]http://puu.sh/ejrmF/e4ed4e0f6d.jpg[/img]

This key will result in better items from the Crystal key Chest.
[/SPOILER]

[SPOILER=Boss Update #1]
This update marks the re-introduction of the Dagannoth Kings into the server.

Using the Boss Teleport you can teleport to the Dagannoth Cave and navigate your way to the ladder which leads to the Kings.

Note:
With this addition comes the addition of some new NPCs, this includes: Dagannoth Fledgeling, Dagannoth, Giant Rock Crab.
[/SPOILER]
[SPOILER=Boss Update #2]
This new Boss area can be located in the Lumbridge graveyard by using the ladder found there.
[img]http://puu.sh/egQYn/de194b9065.jpg[/img]

You can enter here and find Disciple of Thurgo (level 67) and Thurgo the Great, to get to Thurgo inside the fire you must defeat his Disciples and randomly when killed they will fill a bucket (must be in inventory) with Blessed water. Once the bucket is filled you can use it to access Thurgo.
[img]http://puu.sh/egR8D/521b65602f.jpg[/img]

[/SPOILER]
[SPOILER=Boss Update #3]
Under the &#39;Boss Teleports&#39; section you can now find a new boss, this is Transmute&#39;s pet, Jubster.

Jubster is a medium-level boss which uses both Range and Mage combat-styles. His max hit is currently a 15.
[img]http://puu.sh/ejno1/4e8cac4555.jpg[/img]


While fighting Jubster, if his Hitpoints drop below half Transmute will heal him, this effect is negated if you can get Jubster down to 50 or below Hitpoints. (205 hitpoints total).
[img]http://puu.sh/ejnr5/94d060335a.jpg[/img]

Unlike other bosses when defeated Jubster will drop a key which in return grants you access to Transmute&#39;s chest. This chest gives you 7 random items when opened.
[img]http://puu.sh/ejoVN/1c1a4420e7.jpg[/img]
[/SPOILER]

[SPOILER=Boss Update #4]
Using the &#39;Boss Teleport&#39; option you can now navigate to the new Ourg Statue boss, this boss has very high Attack and Defence, and his HP is roughly 215. 

This boss is in multi and it is meant for groups or a very high level player.
