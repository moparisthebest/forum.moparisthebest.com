[center][b][u][size=24pt]How To Live Life Free[/size][/u][/b][/center]

      Hello, and thank you for coming to my thread. I bet your wondering, why in the hell would I ever want to live life free, or cheap. Well, think about it, no more work, nothing. I wrote this thread for all the slackers, may it help you all. Here&#39;s some of the things this thread will show you how to do:

[center][size=18pt][u][b]Where/How to live[/b][/u][/size][/center]

     Now, we all need to live somewhere, let that place be a mansion or under a bridge, ALL of us put our head down on something. If your a cheap bastard, heres some ways you can live for free, or cheap. Theres always the road, or under a bridge, but heres some real good ones. Find a broken down hotel/motel/apartment and break into it. Chances are that the bed will still be there, theres your living quarters. If you live by water, there will always be rich people, stake out a yacht, or boat and after a few days once youv&#39;e found an unused one, sleep in it. There might be some food or drink on it, and it&#39;s pretty good to sleep in. Theres a few good places to sleep at night.


[center][size=18pt][u][b]Eat and Drink[/b][/u][/size][/center]

      Everyone needs to eat, and drink. So heres where you can get it free or cheap. Goto a mall, or department store like BJ&#39;s or Sam&#39;s Club and scout out the free samples, you&#39;ll look stupid, but after 20 pizza bites, 7 or 8 icecream samples, and chicken cordon bleu, your filled up. Now its time to quench that manly thirst of yours. Water fountains are a bum&#39;s best friend. But, if you want more than the flavorless taste of water, heres how to get free soda. For those that DON&#39;T know how to do this, morons ahhaha. Just walk into any Mc Donalds and ask for a cup of water, then just fill it with soda, the most they will do is say give it back, and who&#39;s going to listen to some 16 year old nerd with zits? Or the 50 something year old hispanic manager that&#39;s screaming something at you and you don&#39;t care. Save the cup for next time, they might not give another after that episode.


[center][size=18pt][u][b]Clothes[/b][/u][/size][/center]

       Since nudity is criminal, everyone needs clothes, wheather it be a tight thong bikini, or a snow suite, something needs to be on your body. Heres some places to get some free stuff. If you can swallow your pride, find a thrift shop. Wait until night when it is closed and goto the back CHING CHING. There is tons of stuff here that no one wanted and gave to the thrift shop, you&#39;ll find clothes, among many other things, just get something that fits and walk away.


[center][size=18pt][u][b]Travel[/b][/u][/size][/center]

      Your feet can only carry you so far, so your going to need something to take you to where you want to go. Hitchhiking is always an option but I HIGHLY discourage it. Bad things can happen. Theres always sneaking on the buses though. Just wait at the bus stations, and if you live in any kind of county, chances are that your buses have two doors, when everyone else is paying there ways through the front, sneak in through the back door, since both doors open when he opens the door. Another way to get around is a bike, find one in the trash, or you can pick one up from a street corner, behind most mexican or asian restaraunts, or the unsuspecting 11 yr old that is riding behind you beeping you with his horn, I would steal the bike and shove the horn down his throat, but you shouldn&#39;t. 


[center][size=18pt][u][b]Communications[/b][/u][/size][/center]

       Have a friend, wanna talk, here&#39;s how you can talk on a phone, or over the internet for free. For the phones, if you would like to be a nice person, goto an office, library, or police department and use the free phone. If you want unlimited time, well, one or two conversations, then follow this. Look the people around you and try to scope out the rich, bald, fat, weak people. I garuntee they will have a cell phone, if you canconvince them to let you use it for an emergency, then take the phone, and as you talk, start pacing back and forth, act urgent, you don&#39;t even need to call anyone. As soon as you can DIP! Just run as fast as you can as far as you can, if you chose the right guy, your home free, as long as there are no cops or strong types around. Since the poor chump has no phone now, he&#39;ll have to borrow someones to call the police, or go home. Just use the phone and toss it, because I garuntee some fines if you get caught. For the internet, there is the nice way only, just walk into a library, and go on the internet, download your chat software and have fun.

I hoped you liked my tutorial, it took like 20 min to make, feedback would be nice.</description>

<pre><code>  Hello, and thank you for coming to my thread. I bet your wondering, why in the hell would I ever want to live life free, or cheap. Well, think about it, no more work, nothing. I wrote this thread for all the slackers, may it help you all. Here's some of the things this thread will show you how to do:

<p>[center][size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Where/How to live</span></span>[/size][/center]</p>
<pre><code> Now, we all need to live somewhere, let that place be a mansion or under a bridge, ALL of us put our head down on something. If your a cheap bastard, heres some ways you can live for free, or cheap. Theres always the road, or under a bridge, but heres some real good ones. Find a broken down hotel/motel/apartment and break into it. Chances are that the bed will still be there, theres your living quarters. If you live by water, there will always be rich people, stake out a yacht, or boat and after a few days once youv'e found an unused one, sleep in it. There might be some food or drink on it, and it's pretty good to sleep in. Theres a few good places to sleep at night.
</code></pre>
<p>[center][size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Eat and Drink</span></span>[/size][/center]</p>
<pre><code>  Everyone needs to eat, and drink. So heres where you can get it free or cheap. Goto a mall, or department store like BJ's or Sam's Club and scout out the free samples, you'll look stupid, but after 20 pizza bites, 7 or 8 icecream samples, and chicken cordon bleu, your filled up. Now its time to quench that manly thirst of yours. Water fountains are a bum's best friend. But, if you want more than the flavorless taste of water, heres how to get free soda. For those that DON'T know how to do this, morons ahhaha. Just walk into any Mc Donalds and ask for a cup of water, then just fill it with soda, the most they will do is say give it back, and who's going to listen to some 16 year old nerd with zits? Or the 50 something year old hispanic manager that's screaming something at you and you don't care. Save the cup for next time, they might not give another after that episode.
</code></pre>
<p>[center][size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Clothes</span></span>[/size][/center]</p>
<pre><code>   Since nudity is criminal, everyone needs clothes, wheather it be a tight thong bikini, or a snow suite, something needs to be on your body. Heres some places to get some free stuff. If you can swallow your pride, find a thrift shop. Wait until night when it is closed and goto the back CHING CHING. There is tons of stuff here that no one wanted and gave to the thrift shop, you'll find clothes, among many other things, just get something that fits and walk away.
</code></pre>
<p>[center][size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Travel</span></span>[/size][/center]</p>
<pre><code>  Your feet can only carry you so far, so your going to need something to take you to where you want to go. Hitchhiking is always an option but I HIGHLY discourage it. Bad things can happen. Theres always sneaking on the buses though. Just wait at the bus stations, and if you live in any kind of county, chances are that your buses have two doors, when everyone else is paying there ways through the front, sneak in through the back door, since both doors open when he opens the door. Another way to get around is a bike, find one in the trash, or you can pick one up from a street corner, behind most mexican or asian restaraunts, or the unsuspecting 11 yr old that is riding behind you beeping you with his horn, I would steal the bike and shove the horn down his throat, but you shouldn't. 
</code></pre>
<p>[center][size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Communications</span></span>[/size][/center]</p>
<pre><code>   Have a friend, wanna talk, here's how you can talk on a phone, or over the internet for free. For the phones, if you would like to be a nice person, goto an office, library, or police department and use the free phone. If you want unlimited time, well, one or two conversations, then follow this. Look the people around you and try to scope out the rich, bald, fat, weak people. I garuntee they will have a cell phone, if you canconvince them to let you use it for an emergency, then take the phone, and as you talk, start pacing back and forth, act urgent, you don't even need to call anyone. As soon as you can DIP! Just run as fast as you can as far as you can, if you chose the right guy, your home free, as long as there are no cops or strong types around. Since the poor chump has no phone now, he'll have to borrow someones to call the police, or go home. Just use the phone and toss it, because I garuntee some fines if you get caught. For the internet, there is the nice way only, just walk into a library, and go on the internet, download your chat software and have fun.
</code></pre>
<p>I hoped you liked my tutorial, it took like 20 min to make, feedback would be nice.</p>
