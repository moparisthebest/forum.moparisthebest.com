<p><span class="bbcode-u">Introduction:</span> <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/coolc164.png?v=9" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>
<p>You may be wondering: Dead as a Doornail? <span class="bbcode-b">What The Fuck?</span> :eek:<br>
To properly understand this, you need to have the proper knowledge of doornail history and be up to date with the latest doornail information. I’ll give you this through images and text and a little FAQ. Thus begins my trilogy on doornails.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The History Behind The Doornail:</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[Q] Why a Doornail?</span></p>
<p>[A] This is an ancient expression: we have a reference to this dating back to 1350, and it also appears in the fourteenth-century work The Vision of Piers Plowman and in Shakespeare’s Henry IV. Another expression, of rather later date, is as dead as a herring, because most people only saw herrings when they were long dead and preserved; there are other similes with the same meaning, such as dead as mutton, or dead as a stone.</p>
<p>But why particularly a doornail, rather than just any old nail? Could it be because of the repetition of sounds, and the much better rhythm of the phrase compared with the version without door? Almost certainly the euphony has caused the phrase to survive longer than the alternatives I’ve quoted. But could there something special about a doornail?</p>
<p>The usual reason given is that a doornail was one of the heavy studded nails on the outside of a medieval door, or possibly that the phrase refers to the particularly big one on which the knocker rested. A doornail, because of its size and probable antiquity, would seem dead enough for any proverb; the one on which the knocker sat might be thought particularly dead because of the number of times it had been knocked on the head.</p>
<p>But William and Mary Morris, in The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins, quote a correspondent who points out that it could come from a standard term in carpentry. If you hammer a nail through a piece of timber and then flatten the end over on the inside so it can’t be removed again (a technique called clinching), the nail is said to be dead, because you can’t use it again. Doornails would very probably have been subjected to this treatment to give extra strength in the years before screws were available. So they were dead because they’d been clinched. It sounds plausible, but whether it’s right or not we will probably never know.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">[Q]What does it mean?!</span></p>
<p>[A]This is an idiom.</p>
<p>Also can be dead as a dodo or herring, meaning totally or assuredly dead; also finished. For example, The cop announced that the body in the dumpster was dead as a doornail, or The radicalism she professed in her adolescence is now dead as a dodo, or The Equal Rights Amendment appears to be dead as a herring. The first, oldest, and most common of these similes, all of which can be applied literally to persons or, more often today, to issues, involves doornail, dating from about 1350. Its meaning is disputed but most likely it referred to the costly metal nails hammered into the outer doors of the wealthy (most people used the much cheaper wooden pegs), which were clinched on the inside of the door and therefore were “dead,” that is, could not be used again. Dead as a herring dates from the 16th century and no doubt alludes to the bad smell this dead fish gives off, making its death quite obvious. Dead as a dodo, referring to the extinct bird, dates from the early 1900s.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[Q] Did any famous people use it?</span></p>
<p>[A] Yes.</p>
<p>his is old - at least 14th century. There’s a reference to it in print in 1350:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"For but ich haue bote of mi bale I am ded as dorenail." </code></pre>
<p>Shakespeare used it in King Henry VI:</p>
<p>CADE:</p>
<p><code>Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was
broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I
have eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou and
thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead
as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.</code></p>
<p>As ‘X’ as ‘Y’ similes refer to some property and then give an example of something well-known as exhibiting that property, e.g. ‘as white as snow’. Why door-nails are cited as a particular example of deadness isn’t clear. Door-nails are the large-headed studs that were used in earlier times for strength and more recently as decoration. The practise was to hammer the nail through and then bend over the protruding end to secure it. This process, similar to riveting, was called clenching. This may be the source of the ‘deadness’, as such a nail would be unusable afterwards.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[Q] I want to be able to say doornail in other languages!</span></p>
<p>[A] Well, look no further.</p>
