        <p>Wow, I just found something weird to do in a lucid dream.</p>
<p>When you become lucid, walk through a doorway, and try to pretend, and expect that it is the door to your bedroom or where ever you are sleeping. Also, try to expect to see your body laying there, in bed. It feels so weird, like you died and you became a spirit and can still see your body. When you wake up, your body will be in the same position it was when you first walked in. For example, if you walk in, and pick up and move your physical arm, it wont really move in real life. So now, look at how your body is positioned in the bed, and try to remember that. Then, open your eyes as wide and as hard as you can, and wake up. You will be in that exact position.</p>
<p>I have only been able to do that once though. Next time, I will start interacting with it, and basically throw stuff at myself (like my T.V. etc.), to see what happens.</p>

        <p>[quote=“jme_009, post:1, topic:1561”]Hey, if you don’t know what lucid dreaming is, it’s the ability to control your dreams.</p>
<p>I’m sure most of you have experienced this at least once, I know I have many times however in the morning I wonder why I didn’t do things I always wanted to do, so obviously I’m not in total control.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it is possible to train yourself for lucid dreaming, I have been training for 2 years and I have learnt a lot. Whether you think it or not, you have many many dreams every night. If you think you don’t, your wrong, you just simply cannot remember them. Nowadays I can remember at least 3-5 dreams every night. Someday I hope to have lucid dreams at my will, because I could then accomplish anything. Not only can you control your dreams, but you can control how long you stay in them as well. Obviously not forever, but some are able to spend several hours in a dream, doing as they wish.</p>
<p>Obviously some are going to choose not to believe this, but all I can say is that I have had the experience several times and it is amazing.</p>
<p>So… You can search google for information on training, but before doing so you need to do a lot of stuff. Make sure you get a good nights sleep, every night. 8 hours is a good amount, 10 is even better(weekends are usually good for this). In the morning, write down your dreams if you can remember any. Do this EVERY morning. You need to find a pattern in your dreams, or a re-occuring event. It really helps a lot to do this. For me, swimming pools and long dark hallways seem to happen almost everynight. And, without the ability to remember your dreams you cannot remember if you have had a lucid dream. If you wake u in the middle of the night, jot down part of your dream and see if you can recall the whole thing in the morning. Jot down Who, where, what, and when. Eventaully you’ll find a common element in all your dreams, which I believe are called dream signs. Now if you want, go search google for some tips and guides on lucid dreaming, but you HAVE TO master remembering your dreams before doing so.</p>
<p>So, disucss what you feel on lucid dreaming. I have a feeling many people here will flame me or something, but at least give it a try. Try doing this for like 2 weeks, and come back if you notice any trends. Someday I hope to be able to control my dreams, Im not far from it either.</p>
<p>Discuss what you think![/quote]dude!! i thought that was just me… i always try to control my dreams and i get pissed when people are like “i dont have dreams” because its just thinking but your completely consentrated. my faverate thing is flying when i figure out its a dream. but i always try to do somthing but i get distracted and forget what im doing and that its a dream. i remembor one time i knew it was a dream so i was running somewhere and i triped and i felt real pain it was weird.  i never knew there were ways to train ur self to do this and that it had a name.</p>
<p>edit: i read some more after the first post… i have add so its even more distracting for me but when i was high and half asleep i relized that a min when your absolutly focused goes by in a sec because the mind is not using pure launguig it uses pure thought and doesnt have to translate everything(slowing down the thinking procces)</p>
<p>edit2: the season we dont remembor our dreams is because its somthing we want to get over with, because we want to get the day started. so i guess lucid dreaming is just learning to like dreams.</p>
<p>i sayd that i have add and i get distracted but add also makes you want to daydream and you altemitly controll those.<br>
people think add means you are completely distracted but only on things you dont like, but if you have add and you like playing rs you super focus and nothing else can break the focus.<br>
back on topic when i dream you can play a drum solo right beside me(has been done) and i will not wake up, but say my name as quiet as you want and i will wake up.</p>
<p>edit3: i hate when i have somthing in m hand like a loly or somthing <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> and then i wake up and it just dissapears and my hand closes all the way and i look and im pissed![br][size=1]Posted at: July 17, 2006, 01:17:38 PM[/size][hr][quote=“Got_Shine, post:45, topic:1561”]Wow… crazy topic. I just need some maryjane and a bed :P. Once I had a lucid dream, that I can remember at least.<br>
I was napping for some reason (I do it maybe 3 times a year) and I was in my room with some girl, know one I knew she was hot I’m assuming, and I went to play around with her, and ok get this We have this motion activated thing that plays music and its fairly high off the ground and my cat is trying to get something on the shelf its on and I guess cast a shadow on it or something and it starts going off and I wake up and I’m like wtf is this shit… Anyway thats it.</p>
<p>My theory however is that you control every dream you have, but the ammount of control you have is varied, maybe that doesn’t make sence. I just don’t understand why a dream would be like a movie, considering you’re the one whos making it up.[/quote]when im high all real is like a dream and i just sit back and watch.[br][size=1]Posted at: July 17, 2006, 01:56:03 PM[/size][hr][quote=“Cheesehunk, post:94, topic:1561”]Hmmm, possibly…</p>
<p>Or maybe it is like only used for temporary use, and Scientests cannot recognize that.</p>
<p>Example: When we dream, we create huge worlds, out of nothing!</p>
<p>When you are asleep, I think the whole way the brain works is completely different.[/quote]we use 10% but some of the rest is our unconshus brain(bad spelling). thats what tells us to put one foot infrount of the other when your conshus brain says “walk”.</p>
<p>im not sure if this is correct or that unconshus if part of the 10%.[br][size=1]Posted at: July 17, 2006, 02:29:37 PM[/size][hr]if you have a sleep timer on your tv, and u want to lucid dream you should use it because when i dont i cant remembor my dreams. and “they” say that you  dont get a full sleep if theres sound like tv or radeo in the background.</p>
<p>but i saw someone mention a site that had sounds and stuff and wkes you up, thats probly good though.[br][size=1]Posted at: July 17, 2006, 02:39:48 PM[/size][hr]</p><blockquote>Lucid dreaming isent jumping out of a window and turning into superman, if your actualy aware in a dream and able to concusly influance it it cant go against what you would exspect in RL!</blockquote>ok dude when i relize its a dream i have good control and not only on things that i can do in real life, i can fly and evrything im not just making things up when i wake up.
<p>ok i read more: you say you have to beleve it but when i dream and i know i am i realise that it is a dream so i know i can do what ever i want. and it is oveos that if your stuck in yor frame of mind that you cant, then you wont be able to because you only beleve that you cant.</p>

        <p>It looks pretty interesting, and definately worth the effort. ABC recently had a report on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Story?id=3936448&amp;page=1" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Story?id=3936448&amp;page=1</a></p>
<blockquote>   Somewhere in between the Cinderella school of dreaming and the darker dreamscape of "The Matrix" lies Stephen LaBerge, an expert in a technique called lucid dreaming. He believes that what happens to people in their dreams is as real an experience as what happens in real life.
<p>By becoming aware that they’re dreaming while they’re asleep, lucid dreamers say they can learn to consciously control and manipulate the dreamscape, allowing them to live out their wildest fantasies in a virtual reality with no earthly boundaries.</p>

        <p>Lucid dreaming where you’re in control is best. I’ve been doing astral projection on an almost-daily basis for a while now. Problem is, I’ve started projecting even when I don’t want to. Not fun. Not fun at all.</p>

        <p>That’s a problem I have with what is written about astral projection. I think the problem for most people is that they are simply taught the wrong technique. It’s extremely easy for me, and probably only because I have my own method of projecting. I won’t try to explain it; it would get skewered as badly as all the other projection techniques and wouldn’t work.</p>

<p>That’s a problem I have with what is written about astral projection. I think the problem for most people is that they are simply taught the wrong technique. It’s extremely easy for me, and probably only because I have my own method of projecting. I won’t try to explain it; it would get skewered as badly as all the other projection techniques and wouldn’t work.</p>

<p>i see, well anyway i wanna try astral hearing first, so i’m focusing on chakra sounds.</p>

        <p>Sorry if this is already explained, but what is the difference between a lucid dream and astral projection? Is AP when you are awake, and differing in other ways?</p>

        <p>Well I never thought this community would believe in something like this. Although I want to experience it I’ve never tried lucid dreaming; I would never get into the habit of checking the time every 5 minutes etc. But from an article in phrack I found out that for an out of body experience sometimes it is good to just let yourself fall backwards and do not make any attempt to stop yourself. Of course you have to make sure your actually dreaming to do this, but the writer claimed to have gone downstairs in his dream seen his girlfriend on the couch and memorised the scene. As he went down stairs later it was exactly the same.</p>
<p>If anybody wants any of my resources on the subject just ask and I will post as Ive came across a few in my time on the internets I also have some hypnotism ones.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be a good idea to make a dream board or perhaps an “occult” section It would be nice to discuss things like this without all the weirdos that think their vampires etc that generally plague that kind of forum.</p>
