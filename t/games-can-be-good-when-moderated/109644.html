<p>[font=Times New Roman]<span class="bbcode-b">Games Can Be Good, When Moderated (Thesis)</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Not all games are bad!</span> A lot of parents today think that video games are a creation of the devil (figuratively speaking). But that’s not quite true! So I’ve thought the best way to get the attention of parents would be to write about it myself, in an essay. Which really proves a point: gamers can be smart too!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">Games can be educational.</span></span> There’s a large majority of people out there saying that video games are mind numbing, brainwashing, pixels that the player can control. In some cases that can be true, but there are games that are specially meant for teaching the new generation of children. Sometimes the educational aspects of games are hard to notice and sometimes the whole game itself is meant to teach math or any other subject of education. The widely known educational company, <span class="bbcode-i">Scholastic</span>, has made quite a few games themselves that teach multiple grades from Kindergarten to 5th grade and so on. Keep in mind next time when you go to the video game store to check the plots of the games you plan on buying for your children (not to mention the rating too!).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">DON’T BLAME THE DEVELOPERS!</span></span> There’s a lot of hype spreading around about video game developers trying to brainwash today’s children into doing bad things, or being influenced by the games they play. NOT TRUE! If your kid tries to imitate what they saw in a video game then it simply shows that they’re either not mature enough to play video games yet, or you simply aren’t moderating what games they play. A lot of parents these days don’t pay attention to what kind of games they buy for their children. A perfect example would be game ratings. Some parents don’t check the rating of the game they buy for their children or they just go and buy a game that their kid chose, without checking the rating. There have been many cases of parents buying their kids games like <span class="bbcode-i">Grand Theft Auto™</span>, which is rated <span class="bbcode-i">Mature</span> (for ages 17 and up). After a while of their kids playing games like that, parents start to notice odd behavior from their kids (like imitating what they saw in a game), sometimes resulting in violence (reenacting a mature video game). This is where trouble starts. After the parents notice what their kids are doing, they start to blame the developers of the game  that their kids were reenacting. But the thing is, the parents really need to blame themselves. Why? Because they are the ones who bought the game and let their kid play it in the first place! So be sure to moderate what your kids play.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">Games can just simply be fun!</span></span> My last point about video games is that I know a lot of parents out there want their kids to grow up to be smart ‘n all, but they also need to have fun. Games can really be fun if you look at the positive aspect about them. Sure, playing outside is fun and not to mention an important thing of childhood, but what if you are sick and can’t go play outside with your friends? If you can’t go outside, then you can play video games. There are also many other things you can do inside other than playing video games, of course. But kids these days grow up around technology and they usually learn to become accustomed to it. There are simple rules gamers should follow though to continue to have fun playing games: 1) Take breaks often to avoid health problems! 2) Go outside and get some exercise every day. 3) Maintain a social life; get some friends; and go to outdoor events/join a sport. Parents should take those rules to mind and do their best to enforce them to any of their children that play video games. Again, games can be fun, in moderation.</p>
<p>My conclusion to this essay is: as long as you (the parents) moderate what games your children play and for how long; your kids should still be able to have a stable social life with friends and sports. Just <span class="bbcode-i">please</span> don’t blame any of the game developers if your kid does something wrong that was from a game. Your children’s fate rests upon your shoulders.[/font]</p>

        <p>I have something to add, this really pissed me off that my parents thought the opposite of this.</p>
<p>We don’t play games because its obsesivly killing things, we play becuase its fun, not the killing part but the excitment. If we played games JUST to kill things, we wouldn’t hack becuase it would take away the fun of killing things (if u like to kill things [zodiac]).</p>
